<HL> Law: Non-Lawyers May Get 'Partner' Titles Under New Washington, D.C., Bar Code </HL>

   In a move that would represent a major break with tradition in the legal profession, law firms in this city may become the first in the nation to reward non-lawyers with the cherished title of partner. 

   The District of Columbia Bar has recommended adoption of a new code of ethics that would permit such a move, reflecting broad changes in the kind of legal services offered by the city's firms. 
The new ethics code must be approved by the D.C. Court of Appeals before it goes into effect and will apply only to lawyers and law firms that practice here. 

   The professional conduct of lawyers in other jurisdictions is guided by American Bar Association rules or by state bar ethics codes, none of which permit non-lawyers to be partners in law firms. 

   The ABA has steadfastly reserved the title of partner and partnership perks (which include getting a stake of the firm's profit) for those with law degrees. 

   But Robert Jordan, a partner at Steptoe &amp; Johnson who took the lead in drafting the new district bar code, said the ABA's rules were viewed as "too restrictive" by lawyers here. 
"The practice of law in Washington is very different from what it is in Dubuque," he said. 

   Mr. Jordan said the provision allowing non-lawyers to be partners reflects shifts in providing legal services that have already occurred at many Washington law firms, which in recent years have hired high-level economists, accountants, lobbyists and other regulatory specialists. 
Several firms have also launched business subsidiaries and consulting arms specializing in trade, lobbying and other areas. 

   Arnold &amp; Porter, which with 300 lawyers is the largest law firm in Washington, pioneered some of these trends. 
It operates a lobbying business, a bank-consulting firm and a real-estate arm which together have 60 employees, most of whom aren't lawyers. 
Arnold &amp; Porter also employs 18 non-lawyer specialists to augment different areas of its legal practice. 

   Some of these non-lawyer employees are paid at partners' levels. 
Yet, not having the partner title "makes non-lawyers working in law firms second-class citizens," said Mr. Jordan of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. 
James Jones, the managing partner of Arnold &amp; Porter agreed. 
"It's tough for a non-lawyer to feel equal." 
Mr. Jones also emphasized that non-lawyer specialists helped his law firm deliver legal services more efficiently and economically. 

   In 1983, after a heated debate, the ABA rejected a proposal to let non-lawyers be partners. 
Members' chief concerns were that it could lead to a situation where businesses took control of law firms and that non-lawyers couldn't be trusted to uphold the legal profession's ethical and professional standards. 

   The district bar narrowed its proposal to address some of these issues. 
Its proposed new code says businesses can't acquire financial stakes in law firms, and holds attorneys responsible for the ethical behavior of their non-lawyer partners. 

   Still, some lawyers are dubious. 
"Non-lawyers are not trained in the same way," said Jamie Gorelick, a partner at a Washington law firm and member of the bar committee that drafted the new code. 

   The local appeals court will vote on the code after a comment period ending Dec. 1. 
Only a handful of comments have been received so far, mostly concerning other provisions of the code, according to the clerk's office. 

   While he awaits the court's decision, Mr. Jordan compared those who don't want to let non-lawyers be partners to the Dr. Seuss characters called Star Bellied Sneetches, who taunt those who don't have stars on their bellies. 
"They think you can't be a partner because you don't have that law degree on the wall," he said.

<HL> Economy: Operating Rate Of Factories Hits Eight-Year High </HL>

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at their highest rate in more than eight years in October, using 84% of their capacity, the Federal Reserve Board reported. 

   In a second report, the Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.7% in September, reaching a seasonally adjusted $749.38 billion. 
In August, inventories increased a revised 1.1%. 

   October's operating rate, which followed a revised 83.8% rate in September, matched the rate of February 1980 and was slightly below the January 1980 rate of 84.1%. 
The utilization rate for manufacturing alone in October was 84.3% after running at a revised 84.1% the month before. 
Utilities and mines were less pressed; the rate for utilities edged up to 80.8% from 80.6% in September while that for mines dropped to 81.8% from 82.4%. 

   When capacity-utilization rates creep too close to full capacity, economists worry that efficiency will decline and production bottlenecks will occur, leading to shortages and ultimately to higher prices. 
But Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that while the latest figures suggest that danger, the threat isn't yet severe. 

   "I think October's capacity numbers reflect a bounce-back in orders, industrial production and economic activity that is going to continue over the next several months," he said. 
"I think the tightening of the capacity numbers does suggest some additional wage and inflation pressure, but I think manufacturers have developed a cost-control mindset that is going to hold the lid on prices and costs." 

   The increase in factory operating rates came mostly in durable-goods industries, particularly motor vehicles and parts. 

   While the rise in the nation's business inventories was solid in September, sales were little changed from the month before, totaling $495.45 billion compared with $495.48 billion in August. 
September inventories represented 1.51 months' sales, up from 1.50 in August. 

   Although business inventories rose across the board, manufacturers and retailers reported far larger increases than wholesalers. 
Stocks of manufacturers were up 0.6% and their inventory-sales ratio reached 1.57 months. 
Retailers' inventories grew 1.5% from August, pushing their inventory-sales ratio to 1.65. 
Wholesale stocks inched up 0.1% with the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.28. 

   Increasing inventories sometimes foreshadow economic downturns because they can lead to cuts in production. 
But economists said yesterday's figures indicate businesses are keeping inventories largely in line with sales. 

   Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on business inventories and sales in September. The figures are in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted:

                                     (billions of dollars)

<HL> Technology: AT&amp;T Team Discovers Superconductors That Upset Prior Scientific Assumptions </HL>

<TEXT>
   Researchers at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. have discovered a new family of superconductors that may help scientists' understanding of the important electrical phenomenon. 

   The AT&amp;T compounds, concocted from lead, strontium, copper oxide and other materials, don't break any performance records for superconductors and may never find any practical applications. 
But their unexpected properties upset some prior scientific assumptions about superconductivity and may speed the current, world-wide search for better, commercially useful superconducting materials. 

   "It's helping us build up an overall picture of what superconductivity's about," said one prominent British scientist familiar with the AT&amp;T work. 
AT&amp;T's unearthing of the new superconductor family confirms most physicists' view that "there may well be many more (superconductors) to be discovered" -- some of them better-performing -- said Colin Gough, head of the superconductivity-research group at the University of Birmingham, England. 

   A report of the AT&amp;T discovery is to be published today in Nature, a leading British scientific journal that often prints superconductor studies. 
First news of the work was discussed last week by scientists at a materials-research conference in Strasbourg, France. 
Sixteen AT&amp;T scientists at the New York-based company's Murray Hill, N.J., Bell Laboratories co-authored the Nature report. 
They were led by AT&amp;T scientists Robert J. Cava and Bertram Batlogg, two pioneers of superconductor research. 

   The once-quiet study of superconductivity became one of the hottest fields in physics after a 1986 discovery by scientists at International Business Machines Corp. Normally, all materials put up some energy-wasting resistance to an electric current passing through them. 
But a superconducting material, when chilled, loses all resistance. 
The IBM researchers found a superconducting material that needed comparatively little chilling -- raising the possibility of cheaper, faster computers, electric-power stations and other electrical devices made from the materials. 

   Since 1986, four main families of "high-temperature" superconductors have been identified. 
The fifth, AT&amp;T's discovery, is a distant cousin of the earlier varieties -- based, like most of them, on copper oxide laced with other elements. 
AT&amp;T's family adds lead and strontium as basic structural elements; any of several other elements, added in minute quantities, distinguishes one member of the AT&amp;T family from another. 

   In a telephone interview, Robert Laudise, Bell Laboratories' director of materials chemistry research, said the lead-strontium compounds are unusual in having more copper and less oxygen in their makeup than many scientists previously thought possible for a superconductor. 
It suggests, he said, that scientists searching for better superconductors may have overlooked some low-oxygen materials on the incorrect assumption that they wouldn't work. 
The research, he said, "is just one more clue that fits into the puzzle" of which materials can -- and can't -- work as superconductors. 

   Mr. Laudise said, however, that the new lead-strontium materials themselves may have little immediate practical value. 
They must go through more-costly chilling than many other superconductors, to at least 68 degrees centigrade above absolute zero. (Theoretically equal to minus 273.15 degrees centigrade, absolute zero is the hypothetical temperature characterized by the complete absence of heat.) 
Some other, more-promising superconductors need chilling only to 125 degrees above absolute zero.

   Nerco Inc. said a unit agreed in principle to acquire certain oil and natural-gas properties from Enron Inc., Houston, for about $90 million. 

   The transaction, which is subject to signing of a final agreement, would bring Nerco's total 1988 purchases of Gulf Coast reserves to about $270 million. 
The company's Nerco Oil &amp; Gas Inc. unit said its strategy of acquiring oil and gas reserves during periods of relatively low energy prices "is beginning to show positive strategic and financial benefits." 

   An official said Nerco Oil &amp; Gas, which had operating losses totaling $54.2 million in the past three years, has returned to profitability this year and is comfortable with analysts' projections the unit will show about $10 million in operating profit for all of 1988. 
Rising natural-gas prices and increased production are fueling the rebound, he said. 

   Nerco, which also has interests in coal and precious-metals mining, is 90%-owned by PacifiCorp, a diversified utility holding company based in Portland. 

   Enron said the accord is part of a previously announced plan to sell $200 million to $300 million of non-strategic oil and gas properties. 
With the completion of this latest pact, the company will have sold about $250 million of those properties. 
Proceeds will be used to help reduce Enron's debt, which stands at $3.87 billion.

<HL> Letters to the Editor: Proxmire's Views on the Dollar and Wall Street </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> MON STK SCR </IN>
<G> CNG TRE </G>
<TEXT>
   George Melloan's Business World article "Could Another Market Crash Happen? 
Sure" (op-ed, Oct. 18) regarding my position on the dollar and on stock-market reform contained a number of inaccuracies. 

   First, I have never demanded that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady appear before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the dollar's rise as Mr. Melloan claims in his article. 
What I did was send a letter to Mr. Brady asking him to address the implications of the dollar's recent rise on our current account deficit. 
I also asked him to present his views on the outlook for the current account deficit in the future. 
I made these requests because the Treasury was preparing to submit to the Banking Committee the first report on international economic policy as required by Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade Competitiveness Act of 1988 and because I felt that those issues were important. 

   Mr. Melloan suggests that this was a parting shot at Wall Street. 
Does he suggest that requesting the treasury secretary to present and clarify the administration's view of the outlook for our current account deficit and the growth of our nation's net foreign indebtedness is contrary to the interests of the financial sector? 
That is ironic in light of the widely held view among economists, businessmen and other devotees of a free-market system such as myself that clear, credible, high-quality information will resolve unnecessary uncertainty and permit investors to make their investment decisions with greater confidence. 

   While it had nothing to do with my sending a letter to Secretary Brady, it would also be foolishly simplistic to suggest that a change in the value of the dollar is contrary to the interests of the financial sector. 
First of all, changes in the exchange rate are often associated with a heightened volume of trading that increases the earnings of Wall Street traders. 
Second, as was in evidence between 1985 and 1987, a change in the value of the dollar affects the medium-term outlook for earnings and can generate substantial activity in the equity market. 
Many commentators have attributed the rise in the stock market in 1987 to the improvements in our export -- and import -- competing sectors. 
Surely that was not contrary to the interests of substantial parts of Wall Street. 
Such a simplistic specification, casting me against Wall Street and private enterprise, is both inaccurate and belittles the sophistication of the readers of The Wall Street Journal. 

   Second, Mr. Melloan states that the "markets know quite clearly what Sen. Proxmire has in mind when he calls on Secretary Brady to explain himself. 
He wants a soft currency." 
That is clearly false. 
If Mr. Melloan would only look at my record he would find that when the Banking Committee held hearings in February and July in regard to the Humphrey Hawkins Monetary Policy Report I stated in the record that I feared that a further decline in the dollar would exacerbate economic stagnation in other industrial countries and slow economic growth world-wide. 
I did not then, and do not now, want a soft currency. 
What I do want is to establish a clear, coherent and sustainable policy to reduce our current account deficit over a reasonable time horizon that is consistent with the problems of adjustment that will be experienced by the surplus and the deficit countries and is also consistent with price stability. 
I also believe that the level and future path of the exchange rate are intimately intertwined with the future course of our trade deficit and are therefore the proper subject of concern and debate. 

   Finally, with regard to stock market system reform, Mr. Melloan cavalierly asserts that I made the comment that it "would be better to do the wrong thing than nothing at all." 
I said no such thing. 
Furthermore, many executives in the securities industry strongly supported my efforts to facilitate the modernization of our stock-market system along the lines that Mr. Brady's report suggested. 
Our stock-market system has changed substantially following the innovations in stock-related derivative instruments and our regulatory system has not yet responded to those changes. 
I still believe, as do many professionals in the securities industry, that modernization of our regulatory structure is a high priority for the next administration and the 101st Congress.

<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it is putting $17 billion of New York state debt on CreditWatch with negative implications. 

   New York faces a $1.94 billion budget gap for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, mostly because of a shortage in personal income tax collections. 
The legislature has plugged roughly half the gap, but it needs to find an additional $944 million. 
In addition, the state faces an anticipated shortage the following fiscal year. 

   "We're waiting to see whether the legislature comes up with a program that addresses the problem in a fiscally responsible manner," says Maury Cooper, a vice president at S&amp;P. 
"If they don't we'll downgrade them." 

   Affected are $3.8 billion of double-A-minus general obligation bonds; $2.6 billion of SP-1-plus tax and revenue anticipation notes; $500 million of authorized A-1-plus commercial paper, and $10.1 billion of variously rated moral obligation, lease purchase, guaranteed and contractual obligation debt. 

   Last week, the state released a midyear update to its financial plan identifying possible deficit-reduction measures. 
"With minor exceptions, these alternatives don't address the shortfall in a manner that assures ongoing fiscal balance," S&amp;P warned. 
Some of the proposed actions, it said, "only defer the problem to subsequent fiscal years and are inconsistent with the state's current credit ratings." 

   New York's comptroller, Edward V. Regan, seconded S&amp;P's warning. 
He said measures such as delaying income tax refunds, which the state is considering, "will cause the state to slip back to the old ways of fiscal manipulation." 
He said "genuine and permanent spending restraint is absolutely required."

<HL> Kuhlman Expects To Report a Profit For Fourth Quarter </HL>

<TEXT>
   Kuhlman Corp. "fully expects to be profitable" in the fourth quarter of 1988 after six consecutive quarters of losses, Donald O. Dulude, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   Kuhlman, which makes power transformers and plastic products, reported a net loss of $1.8 million on sales of $46.8 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. 

   In the first nine months of this year, the company posted a net loss of $9.3 million on sales of $131.8 million. 
However, most of the loss in the first three quarters of 1988 came from a net charge of $9.1 million, taken in the third quarter, to reflect the discontinuation of Kuhlman's unprofitable Borse Plastic Products Corp. unit. 
The charge was the last of $13.3 million in restructuring costs for Kuhlman in 1988. 

   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, the company closed unchanged yesterday at $8.375 a share. 

   "We've got the worst behind us," Mr. Dulude said. 
"This restructuring was a drain, not only from a financial standpoint, but also in terms of human resources because everybody was working to stem the losses. 
Now we can direct our attention to moving forward." 

   Mr. Dulude said the company expects to see gains from the early October transfer of some non-metallic automotive fuel tank production to its Canadian operations from U.S. plants. 
Productivity at the company's Blenheim, Ont., plant had been lower than expected this year because of weak demand for Chrysler Corp.'s Eagle Premier sedan, which is built in Canada and uses Kuhlman plastic fuel tanks made there. 
As a result, Kuhlman's Canadian plastics operations had been posting losses. 

   The company said the shift of production will make its Bronson, Mich., plant less profitable. 
But Mr. Dulude said a reconfiguration of the Bronson plant will offset some of the impact. 

   Mr. Dulude said a joint venture with Togo Seisakusyo of Japan should help Kuhlman's spring operations to generate more business with the U.S. manufacturing assembly arms of Asian auto makers and parts suppliers. 

   Mr. Dulude also said the company has been raising prices for Kuhlman's power transformers to catch up with higher raw materials costs seen earlier this year.

   Re Charles W. Baird's Oct. 6 editorial-page article "One Moral Right Unions Don't Have": Cloaking his rhetoric in the mantle of the Constitution, Mr. Baird opposed Rep. Joseph E. Brennan's bill to bar hiring permanent replacements for strikers during the first 10 weeks of a strike as well as American Federation of Government Employees President John Sturdivant's call for agency shops for federal government workplaces. 

   Mr. Baird's reference to preserving the "freedom of association" of nonunion workers ignores the fact that since 1935 the law of the land has tried to protect those who want to be represented by a labor organization of their choice. 
The law's protections have never been strong enough to overcome the persuasive power of some employers who "exercise their right of freedom of speech" to subtly threaten the livelihoods of those who engage in union activity. 

   A 1984 House report cited "the sharp rise over the past twenty years in illegal employer tactics to counter unionization efforts." 
Recent decisions made by pro-management appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the federal courts have further encouraged the union-busters by reducing what little protection the law formerly gave to otherwise defenseless employees. 

   Since unionized employees command substantially higher wages and benefits than most of their unrepresented counterparts, it is obvious that most working men and women would choose to join unions were it not for the heavy-handed tactics of some employers and their friends in positions of authority.

<HL> Securities Rules To Be Rewritten In Britain Again </HL>
<AUTHOR> Craig Forman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> EUROP </CO>
<IN> SCR </IN>
<DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just seven months after introducing a sweeping securities rulebook, Britain plans to overhaul its regulations, replacing a tough regime of business-conduct rules with a looser, simplified code of good-practice principles. 

   The watchdog Securities and Investments Board said its new draft rules assure the same standards of investor protection as the more detailed regulations they replace. 

   Separately, the government said it will repeal a law giving any U.K. investor the right to sue securities firms for breaking financial laws. 
Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said the law as it now stands "could lead to an excessively litigious approach in the financial markets." 
It will be restricted to permit only private investors the statutory right to sue. 

   Britain's new rules still require financial services firms to be pure. 
But the new rulebook -- about two-thirds the length of the old one -- reduces the obligations on firms to demonstrate their purity and their possible legal liability when they aren't. 
SIB Chairman David Walker said, "Less reliance on detailed rules will actually be more effective in protecting investors" because British authorities can crack down on breaches of the code's spirit instead of its written rules. 

   The biggest change in the new code, effective next July, absolves investment firms from strict liability for breaching rules by providing them with the defense they were acting reasonably, or to their best abilities. 
The rules also reduce the level of detail required of firms in so-called know-your-client rules. 
And the code effectively widens the notion of a professional or experienced investor, who gets less protection than small investors. 

   Mr. Walker conceded the new code is "at a higher level of generality," and will increase the discretionary power of the regulators -- most of whom are industry professionals themselves. 
Such changes reduce the regulatory system's predictability and transparency, originally intended to be its virtues. 

   Though the new rules increase the possibility regulators' decisions may favor firms over clients, Mr. Walker said he considers that risk "insignificant when compared to the gain in user-friendliness." 
He added, "I don't think we are taking teeth out, but are putting teeth in more effective parts of the jaw." 

   The rewrite is a substantial turnabout. 
Less than two years ago, a series of financial scandals prompted the election-minded Conservative government to tighten Britain's securities regulatory regime. 
But the rules, effective last April, were sharply criticized as overly complex and costly by the financial services industry. 
Economists estimated compliance costs at $180 million. 

   Since then, the government has become increasingly concerned by industry threats that the system -- the toughest in Europe -- might drive business out of London as the 1992 deadline for removing remaining European Community trade barriers nears. 
Mr. Walker echoed those worries yesterday. 
"We can have highly defined regulation that leaves nothing but desert out there," he said, referring to London's bustling financial district. 

   Meantime, securities industry professionals are rejoicing. 
The Securities Association, leading industry regulator for London's stock and bond markets, welcomed the rewrite and said it is rewriting its own weighty rulebook. 
Other self-regulatory bodies are expected to follow suit. 
The new rules, said the chief securities law expert at one of the biggest U.S. investment banks in London, "simplify things. 
There can be simplification and still be rules."

   You are to be commended for your Nov. 1 article "Men, Too, Wrestle With Career-Family Stress." 
Within the past year, several other publications have reported on the difficulties of effectively managing employment and parental responsibilities but focused on the issue as though it confronted only women. 
As your article pointed out, men are similarly faced with competing compelling pressures. 

   The view of Cynthia Grantz, president of Rockford Coatings Corp., that "child rearing is largely the mother's domain," surely ignores present-day reality. 
Undoubtedly, employer attitudes based on such sexual stereotypes will lead to diminished job satisfaction for parents and, in the long run, the employer's detriment.

   Soured on silver, bored with gold? 
These days, big governments are peddling platinum coins. 

   Australia recently became the first major nation to offer a platinum bullion coin, the Koala. 
Today, the Canadian Royal Mint will unveil its Platinum Maple Leaf. 
And Mexico soon plans to launch a Platinum Libertad. 

   The new issues come amid heightened competition among leading bullion nations for coin investors. 
Dealers say the recent push partly reflects an effort by the platinum industry to polish the metal's image. 

   "Platinum has always been gold's stepchild," says Luis Vigdor, senior vice president of MTB Banking Corp., a large New York dealer. 
The recent coin parade, he says, is a "commercial effort to place platinum at the same level." 

   But don't expect the coins to glitter like gold. 
Platinum -- considered by some the ugly duckling among precious metals even though it costs more -- resembles gun metal, or a dulled silver. 
Like other bullion coins, the new platinum issues will cost about 5% to 7% above the metal's spot-market price, which yesterday closed at $580.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

   Still, platinum is a better buy than other precious metals, some numismatists say. 
Two major factors: its extreme rarity and broad industrial uses. 

   "In the parlance of the dealer, platinum has the sexiest story to tell," says Bruce Kaplan, senior vice president of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., a large Santa Monica, Calif., wholesaler. 

   A report issued this week by Johnson Matthey PLC shows why. 
The big London-based refiner forecasts record platinum demand this year. 
Stemming partly from the new coin issues, demand will outstrip supply by 465,000 ounces in 1988, more than double last year's amount, the report says. 

   If there's a loser in all the activity, it will be the tiny Isle of Man. 
Dealers say that country's Noble coin, until recently the only legal-tender platinum piece on the market, is sure to lose sales. 

   Next on the platinum horizon: the Soviet Union. 
Look for the Russians to offer a platinum coin in the U.S. before year end. 
But unlike the other new issues, it will cater to collectors and won't be legal tender.

   Re your Oct. 27 article "Failure to Wear Seat Belts Can Cut Crash-Suit Awards": It provided a good overview of the issue of mandatory seat-belt use. 

   As a concerned citizen, I for one support the mandatory-use laws and I'm in favor of reduced awards in the case of a victim's injuries being exacerbated through failure to wear a seat belt. 
But the article failed to point out that another reason defense lawyers are fighting this trend is that their contingency fees are at risk. 

   The real issue is the liability-insurance crisis that this country has experienced and its effect on all of society. 
The entire basis of insurance is shared risk. 
All of us share the cost when negligence increases that risk. 
To paraphrase an old adage, "Your right to not wear a seat belt ends at the tip of my insurance bill."

   Kyocera Corp. said unconsolidated, or parent-company, pretax earnings in the first half ended Sept. 30 grew 20%, to 24.73 billion yen ($201.2 million) from 20.62 billion yen a year earlier. 

   Kyocera, Japan's leading maker of ceramic packages for integrated circuits, said net income rose 17%, to 11.82 billion yen from 10.10 billion yen. 
Sales increased 16%, to 151.43 billion yen ($1.23 billion) from 131.02 billion yen. 

   Company officials said sales and earnings were boosted by strong demand for semiconductors and other electronic devices in Japan and abroad. 
Exports increased 12% and were 47% of overall sales. 

   For the full fiscal year, the company expects pretax profit to increase to 51.33 billion yen from 42.60 billion yen the previous year. 
Net income is expected to rise to 24.22 billion yen from 19.88 billion yen, while sales are forecast to increase to 310.43 billion yen from 271.17 billion yen.

   Cie. Financiere de Suez said first-half consolidated, or group, profit fell 19% from a year earlier, but predicted full-year earnings will increase 3% to 17%. 

   The French financial holding company said profit after payments to minority interests dipped to 1.17 billion francs ($197 million) from 1.44 billion francs in 1987's first half. 
Suez linked the erosion to a decrease in revenue from the sale of securities and to an increase in new provisions for loan losses to 1.44 billion francs from 940 million francs a year earlier. 

   Profit growth was also limited by the fact the majority stake Suez bought this year in Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. hasn't been incorporated into its results. 

   These negative elements were partly offset by strong first-half performances by Suez's main operating units. 
Despite the first-half slowdown, Suez predicted profit for all of 1988 will be between 2.2 billion francs and 2.5 billion francs, up from 2.13 billion francs in all of 1987.

<HL> International: Indonesia Official Has Personal Interest In Attempt to Cut Metal Exports to Japan </HL>

   For months, Japan and Indonesia have been feuding over Jakarta's attempt to get a bigger share of the aluminum produced at a jointly owned smelter in Sumatra. 
Now, it turns out that the Indonesian official who triggered the dispute has a personal interest in such a reallocation. 

   Abdul Rauf Suhud, chairman of the Asahan Authority, which oversees the $2.1 billion smelter, justified his demand -- which he backed up by cutting off aluminum exports to Japan -- on national-interest grounds. 
He told a news conference last month that Indonesia deserved a bigger quota than the 41% that coincides with its equity stake because of its "very generous" contributions to the project, such as tax incentives and water for power generation. 
Financially, Mr. Suhud complained, the Indonesian government "virtually doesn't get anything" from the smelter. 

   The aluminum-export ban has angered the Japanese partners, who call it a breach of contract. 
The stoppage, say businessmen and officials from both countries, has harmed Jakarta's ties with Tokyo, Indonesia's largest source of loans and investment. 
The cutoff was imposed in July, although two subsequent shipments to Japan have been allowed. 

   What Mr. Suhud didn't mention at the October press conference was his involvement in a private venture that seeks eventually to process nearly one-third of the smelter's production. 
Called P.T. Asahan Aluminum Alloys, or P.T. AAA, it consists of a new Indonesian company, a new Guernsey, Channel Islands, company, and an existing Indonesian trading company. 
According to documents filed with Indonesia's Capital Investment Coordinating Board, Mr. Suhud represents both the new companies in dealings with Indonesian agencies. 

   There is no evidence that Mr. Suhud, a former industry minister and former deputy chairman of the investment board, is a shareholder in P.T. AAA. 
But the documents establish that he and an Indonesian banker working in Singapore were central to setting it up, with assistance from other Asahan Authority officials. 

   Given current Indonesian domestic use of Asahan aluminum and contract commitments to the Japanese partners, P.T. AAA wouldn't have access to sufficient aluminum unless Japan is forced to accept a cut in its quota. 
P.T. AAA's $28 million plant, to be built within three years near the smelter, is to make aluminum metal for construction materials. 
Approval for the plant was given by the investment board on Aug. 24 -- the day after Mr. Suhud publicly confirmed that he had suspended monthly shipments from the smelter because of the dispute with the Japanese partners. 

   Although Mr. Suhud's connection with the venture has changed the complexion of the Japan-Indonesia quarrel, his connections with the private companies have received scant public attention in Indonesia. 
Japanese officials working on the Asahan dispute are reluctant to discuss the matter for fear of aggravating it. 

   The Asahan chairman has asserted he has full support from the government for his tough line on the Japanese. 
"I couldn't do this sort of thing {suspending exports} if it wasn't acceptable to the government," he told the news conference. 

   Officials at the Finance Ministry, Indonesia's official shareholder in the smelter, say they are working to resolve the dispute quickly but decline to comment further. 
But some government officials privately say they are upset that Mr. Suhud is involved in a private downstream project while at the same time he is a government official overseeing the smelter. 

   Mr. Suhud declined repeated requests by this newspaper to comment on his role with the venture. 
P. Samadiono Samadikun, secretary of the Asahan Authority, says the chairman wants to comply with government instructions not to comment at present "on any subject whatsoever" connected with aluminum. 

   The Japanese partners in the smelter also decline to comment on any aspect of the dispute. 
Half of Japan's 59% stake is jointly held by 12 companies handling aluminum; the other half belongs to the Japanese government. 

   Until they learned of Mr. Suhud's connection with the private processing venture, the Japanese were baffled by his actions, especially the export ban that is costing Indonesia export earnings at a time of high world aluminum prices. 

   The smelter is supposed to give Indonesia 75,000 metric tons a year, or a third of production, whichever is less. 
Mr. Suhud argues this formula covers only the aluminum project's obligation to the Indonesian government, and he claims the rest of output should be divided in accordance with shareholdings. 
That means Indonesia would get 60% of output -- an increase Japan has vehemently resisted. 

   For the investors in P.T. AAA, there may not be a hurry to get the venture moving; it doesn't plan to begin commercial production until late 1990. 
But there is a need for Indonesia and Japan to resolve their argument quickly. 

   Besides causing a big stock buildup at the smelter, harming bilateral ties and cutting Jakarta's export earnings, the aluminum-export ban is damaging Indonesia's investment climate, businessmen from both countries say. 
They add that relations between Mr. Suhud and the Japanese are so sour that it will be almost impossible for the two sides to work together again.

<TEXT>
   The barrage of statistics unleashed by Warren T. Brookes ("Surprise! 
Home Buyers Are Better Off Now," editorial page, Oct. 17) fails to address the dilemma of young families who perceive the American Dream of home-ownership becoming an impossible one as they are increasingly squeezed in today's financial environment. 

   According to the National Association of Realtors, home "affordability" declined sharply from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s. 
Sizable down payments, as much as 25% of the purchase price, combined with other closing costs, many mandated by state regulations, present an all-too-often insurmountable obstacle to first-time buyers. 
Changes in the tax laws in 1986 further undercut the benefits of home-ownership. 

   Today, people commute unprecedented distances to their workplaces in order to own a home they can afford. 
In short, the hunger for ownership has replaced location as the major buyer concern. 
And while buyers sacrifice location to achieve ownership, current trends make the dream more distant than ever. 

   Throughout our history, despite the Great Depression and the economic and social disruptions of two World Wars, Americans took home-ownership for granted. 
They no longer can. 
During the 1980s, for the first time since the Depression, there has been a sustained decline in home-ownership. 
The largest decreases were experienced by those under 25 years old and those in the prime home-buying ages of 25 to 34. 

   Yet too little attention has been given to previously proposed legislation that provides several enlightened remedial measures to narrow the "affordability gap." 
These include changes in the tax code that would allow first-time home buyers to use funds withdrawn (without penalty) from IRA or Keogh accounts for down payment on a principal residence. 

   With home-ownership and derivative industries accounting for 10% of the gross national product, and considering the increase in local tax bases accruing from home-ownership, can we afford not to support these proposals? 

   It is clearly in the interests of our elected officials at all government levels -- city, county, state and national -- to implement effective programs designed to increase opportunities for home-ownership. 
More important, it is in the best interests of our citizenry. 
A growing number of Americans question the capacity of Social Security to provide sufficient income after retirement and the investment in home-ownership provides the only proven means to lifetime security. 

   This is one of the most important issues facing the country today, and it must become a priority of the next administration. 
At stake is nothing less that the foundation of the American way of life as it will be defined in the coming century.

   Sony Corp. said its net income more than doubled in the second quarter ended Sept. 30, as sales soared 46%. 

   The Japanese electronics giant said consolidated, or group, profit rose to 13.08 billion yen ($106.1 million) from 4.76 billion yen a year earlier, as sales grew to a record 528.69 billion yen ($4.29 billion) from 361.36 billion yen. 

   For the fiscal first half, net income more than tripled, to 29.18 billion yen from 8.01 billion yen. 
Sales rose 42%, to 992.26 billion yen from 699.15 billion yen. 

   Sony said sales increased both domestically and abroad, and in all product groups. 
It added that it continues to restructure its operations and reduce costs in an effort to counter the effects of the yen's appreciation. 
That includes shifting production overseas. 
In the second quarter, overseas production accounted for 30% of foreign sales, which in turn made up 67% of total sales. 

   For the full fiscal year, Sony expects net income to exceed 60 billion yen and sales to rise above two trillion yen.

   Vulcan Corp. moved to distribute most of the 520,180 shares of Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. it holds by declaring a special dividend to stockholders. 
The dividend will be in lieu of the company's quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share due in December. 

   The maker of rubber and plastic products said it plans next month at a yet-undetermined date to distribute one share of Eagle-Picher stock for each three shares of Vulcan common held by stockholders of record Nov. 28. 
The special dividend has a current value of about $5.33 a Vulcan share. 

   Vulcan said its action will permit shareholders to make their own determination whether to sell such shares or hold them for a long-term investment. 

   Separately, directors voted to ask shareholders at a Dec. 13 special meeting to change the company's state of incorporation to Delaware from Ohio because Vulcan no longer does any manufacturing in Ohio. 
Its factories are in Tennessee, Arkansas and Wisconsin, with about 78% of its sales generated from products made in Tennessee.

   Allied Irish Banks PLC said pretax profit rose 37% in the first half ended Sept. 30, boosted by higher lending volumes, healthy growth in non-interest income and a reduction in bad-debt charges. 

   The Dublin-based bank said pretax profit rose to 79 million Irish punt ($120.8 million) in the first half from 57.6 million punt a year ago. 
The year-ago figure excludes 9.5 million punt in loan-loss provisions. 

   The results compared with Allied Irish's forecast in September that pretax profit would be "at least" 70 million punt. 
Banking analysts said the results were slightly above expectations. 

   Profit after tax and minorities rose 46% to 52 million punt from 35.7 million punt. 

   An Allied Irish official said negotiations are continuing with First Maryland Bancorp over Allied Irish's offer to buy the 50.3% of First Maryland it doesn't already own for $35.25 a share. 
Last month, a special committee of First Maryland's board recommended that its shareholders reject the Allied Irish offer as inadequate.

   Windmere Corp. said the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington has ruled in favor of the company in antitrust litigation involving N.V. Philips's Norelco shavers. 

   David M. Friedson, Windmere's president, said the court's decision, which reverses a lower court finding for the Dutch-based electronics giant, strengthens Windmere's assertion that Philips is a "monopolist." 

   A spokesman for N.A. Philips Corp., a unit named in the suit along with U.S. Philips Corp., said that Philips, as a matter of policy, doesn't comment on matters under litigation. 

   Windmere, a maker of personal care products, maintains that in 1986 Philips drove it out of the three-head rotary shaver market by offering 35% to 40% discounts on old models of its Norelco shaver, underselling Windmere by 25% to 30%. 

   As a result, Windmere said, it suffered damages in the range of $13 million to $39 million and abandoned the market less than two years later. 
Windmere said it seeks to recover triple damages of between $39 million and $117 million in 1986 dollars, an amount it estimates to be between $50 million to $150 million in 1988 dollars. 

   Windmere said it is unlikely the Supreme Court will choose to hear the case. 
It is probable, the company said, that the suit will be remanded for retrial or settled out of court. 
"We believe we will recover damages plus about $3 million in legal fees," said Mr. Friedson.

   Investor Hugh Culverhouse said he terminated his $20-a-share, or $71.9 million, bid to acquire Coast Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association. 

   Mr. Culverhouse's company, Palmer Financial Corp., said a Federal Home Loan Bank Board resolution last week "rewrote key provisions" of the original acquisition agreement and required conditions on the acquisition that Palmer Financial and Mr. Culverhouse couldn't accept. 

   Coast Federal President Robert W. Antrim said the Sarasota, Fla., thrift's board will meet today with its lawyers and advisers "to see what our next step is. 

   "I don't know what the end result will be," he said. 
In July, Coast Federal said it would take legal action when Mr. Culverhouse said he might terminate the agreement because of concern over the thrift's financial situation. 

   Among the reasons for calling off the bid, Palmer Financial said, was the Bank Board's insistence that Palmer Financial bear the $1.5 million cost of terminating the existing employee stock-option plan. 

   Another condition which helped doom the bid, Palmer Financial said, was the Bank Board's insistence that Mr. Culverhouse inject additional capital into the thrift if the reappraisal of the Palmer Ranch -- a 10,000-acre property being jointly developed by Mr. Culverhouse and the thrift -- required Coast Federal to reduce its capital below certain levels. 

   The Bank Board also required Mr. Culverhouse to provide Palmer Financial with any additional capital it may have needed to pay a $72.5 million loan commitment to Miami-based Southeast Banking Corp.'s Southeast Bank unit. 

   In national over the counter trading Coast Federal closed at $12.625 a share, down $3.375.

   The long campaign to win the presidency is over at last, with a clear winner in the White House and equally clear winners in Congress. 
A long campaign to confront reality must now begin, and the odds against a clear winner are very long. 
But this is the campaign that really counts, because at issue is not victory at the polls, but governance; not media manipulation, but national regeneration. 

   There is little need to emphasize the overwhelming requirement to confront the country's multiple deficit and debt problems. 
Foreign debt, national debt, personal debt and corporate debt: Combined, they have created a mountain of unprecedented size. 
The markets and our allies are equally terrified that George Bush and Congress will be unable to get past the lip-reading stage and cut a political deal. 
For a number of reasons, including my certainty that no one in Washington wants to participate in the murder of economic stability, I think such a deal will be cut. 

   But that mountain having been climbed, the real Alps lie ahead. 
Mr. Bush has said he wants to be an education president, which is a good thing for the country. 
Our educational system, once the basis of national strength and the cornerstone of our civic enterprise, is in rotten condition. 
It produces very well for those who are already blessed at birth. 
It produces very poorly for those whose parents are not white, middle class and/or native-born. 

   Former Labor Secretary William Brock used to make two points about this creeping crisis. 
First, he noted, by the year 2000, about 80% of the new entrants in the labor force will be made up of immigrants, minorities and women. 
As he said, "They are people who have traditionally been disadvantaged. . . . 
And in too many cases, uneducated or improperly educated." 
To quote him again, if we do not reverse course as we plunge headlong into the new information age, the U.S. will create "something we fought a revolutionary war to get away from, and a civil war, and that is a class society." 

   Within 22 years, give or take a few, a majority of all the kids entering the nation's schools will be minorities. 
In other words, the minorities will be the majority, and given the education system's present performance, that majority will not be equipped by its schooling to meet the job requirements of the 21st century. 
As it is, 40% of engineering-school graduates each year are foreigners, as are the vast majority of those doing post-graduate engineering. 
What this says in a country that will need 500,000 new scientists and engineers by 2010 should be obvious. 

   From whatever perspective you confront the issue, the consequences are devastating. 
In the election just ended, the number of people voting as a proportion of those eligible by age to vote failed to go above 50% for the first time in 64 years. 
That stunning failure of civic responsibility should be measured against some Census Bureau calculations on the correlation between educational levels and voter participation in the 1986 midterm elections. 
Only among those who had four years of college or more was participation higher than 50%. 
For those with eight years or less of school, it was 40% and below. 
High-school graduates had a 44.1% level. 

   Some might argue that this is a good thing, that only the best educated should have a say. 
Aside from its anti-democratic bias, that argument ignores the consequences of systematic nonparticipation in politics by a majority of the people. 
Among them are the erosion of truly representative government and the creation of a large class of Americans with no stake in, or concern about, the continued success of free, representative institutions. 

   Perhaps that can be dismissed as idle speculation. 
The republic survived a long time with an electorate far smaller as a percentage of the whole than today's. 
But what is not speculative is the impact on our economic future of the failure to retain and educate all our youngsters. 
In Japan, children are understood to be the most valuable asset. 
The assumption, made manifest in policy and practice, is that all children can and will learn -- and until their middle school years, that they can and will go forward together. 

   In the U.S., there is an implicit assumption that some kids just aren't capable of learning. 
Consequently, many of them don't learn or they drop out of formal education altogether -- at an average of 28.5% between the ninth and 12th grades. 
How that stacks up can be measured by the incredible testing disparities between Japanese and American students and in the competitive advantage given to Japanese industry by a well-educated, self-confident work force. 
Just as we have recklessly squandered the prodigious natural resources, we squander the greatest natural resource of all -- our children -- and both children and society pay for the waste. 

   Education in our federal system is and will remain primarily the domain of state and local government. 
But the federal government is not without ample precedents for decisive intervention. 
Early childhood education in particular is a demonstrated success whose reach should be made universal. 
The president's "bully pulpit" (one of the president-elect's favorite phrases) can mobilize the country as readily against ignorance as against any other adversary. 
The task is to translate the mound of task-force reports and rhetoric into sustained action. 
Without that, the nation is at risk in most of the ways that count.

<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said it signed a long-term licensing agreement with Kyodo Oil for construction of 500 am/pm mini markets at Kyodo-branded gas stations in Japan. 

   Los Angeles-based Arco said the agreement calls for it to provide operating information on its combination convenience store and gas station formula, as well as use of the am/pm name. 
Financial details weren't disclosed. 

   Kyodo is one of Japan's largest oil companies, with more than 6,400 service stations. 
Some existing stations will be converted to the am/pm format and Kyodo plans to build some new outlets. 
The first store is scheduled to open in Tokyo next spring. 

   Arco has more than 700 am/pm stores, which carry basic grocery items, as well as hamburgers and soft drinks. 
The outlets are built on existing gas station sites and are credited with substantially increasing revenue and profit per site for Arco. 

   The formula is said to be attractive to Kyodo because of rising property values in Japan, leading to demands for higher returns from gas station sites to justify continued operation.

<TEXT>
   Code-Alarm Inc., a tiny technology company whose stock price has ridden a roller-coaster in recent months, said it postponed a planned public offering. 

   "Today's market conditions in general are inappropriate for our proposed common stock offering," Rand Mueller, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
"We will therefore delay the offering until the market price for the company's shares is more in line with the real worth of Code-Alarm." 

   The company, which is traded over the counter, has seen its stock trade anywhere from $4.25 a share to $15.375 over the past year. 
Its shares shot up this summer after it announced major contracts with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. to sell its automobile security and keyless entry systems. 
The contracts total $13.3 million, slightly more than Code-Alarm's sales for all of 1987. 

   When it announced the proposed offering in mid-October, it said it expected the new shares -- which would have increased by 50% its 2.1 million shares outstanding -- to sell for about $13 each and yield between $11.7 million and $13.6 million total. 
But the company's stock has been trading close to $9 a share. 
It closed in national over-the-counter trading yesterday at $9.75 a share, up 50 cents.

   Money-market mutual funds posted higher yields in the week ended Tuesday. 

   The average seven-day compounded yield rose to 7.90% from 7.85% last week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. 
The 30-day average compounded yield on all-taxable funds was up to 7.86% from 7.81%. 

   The average maturity of funds shortened to 37 days from 38 days in the previous week. 
Average maturity of funds is an indicator of which direction professional money managers believe interest rates are headed. 
Maturity shortens if rates are expected to rise. 
Shorter-maturity issues allow professional investors to trade up to a higher interest rate sooner. 

   On all-taxable simple yields, the seven-day average was up to 7.60% from 7.56%, while the 30-day average increased to 7.57% from 7.53%.

<IN> RET </IN>
<TEXT>
   National Theme Productions, the nation's biggest Halloween-costume retailer, used to be scared at the prospect of November. 

   With nearly all its sales tied to Halloween, it could only look forward to this month's annual post-mortem of costume trends, conducted to prepare managers for a selling season 11 months away. 

   But this year the closely held San Diego company is taking another holiday for a market. 
At counters in about a quarter of the 1,000 Sears, J.C. Penney's and Montgomery Ward stores where it peddles Halloween costumes, National Theme is selling crystal figurines and jewelry to Christmas shoppers. 
It may then keep 50 of those outlets open year-round. 
And it is thinking about expanding further into Valentine's Day and Easter gifts. 

   National Theme did about $26 million of business this Halloween, which it figures accounts for about 10% of the whole U.S. market. 
But like many small companies that have created their own markets in a narrow, seasonal field, National Theme has found itself locked in, its growth restricted and its hiring and training programs strained. 

   Success of its expansion plan would mean that the current six weeks of selling would grow to six months, doubling the company's sales, while making far better use of its employees. 

   "We need to build a bridge to other seasons," says the company's president, W. Paul Sullivan, who got into the Halloween business selling makeup and costume accessories when he ran a Santa Barbara, Calif., pharmacy. 
"We already have the locations in the department stores for Halloween, and we have 8,000 temporary workers in place. 
We don't want to have to renew the recruiting effort every season." 

   Under the current structure, swings in employment during the year are drastic and costly. 
Most of the year, National Theme operates with a bare-bones staff of about 40 employees, working on marketing strategies or designing costumes for the coming season. 
It subcontracts manufacturing work to San Diego and Tijuana garment makers. 

   By summer, the company is busy recruiting its 120 regional and field managers, often looking to Purdue, Brigham Young and other universities for senior management interns. 
The interns, many of whom return each year for more part-time work, earn as much as $3,000 for the season. 

   Managers learn purchasing, marketing, display and hiring techniques during a weeklong seminar in San Diego -- National Theme calls it the "University of Boo" -- before returning to their sales areas to negotiate for store locations and recruit and train an 8,000-person temporary sales force. 

   National Theme was formed in 1985 with the merger of two competing Southern California companies selling costumes at Sears and Penney's. 
It has added about 150 locations a year since then in the U.S. and Canada, while also working to improve its positioning within stores where it already operates. 
Department stores themselves handle advertising, eliminating one hefty cost for National Theme. 

   National Theme claims to have turned a profit each year since 1985, when it had revenue of about $17.3 million. 
Executives figure the company's popularity with department stores reflects a lack of desire by retailers to invest in such a narrow market themselves -- especially with Christmas fast approaching. 

   Still, the stores are lured by growing Halloween business; at its busiest locations, National Theme sells as much as $5,000 a square foot on an annualized basis. 
It pays department stores a percentage of revenues as rent. 

   The move into crystal started when a Sears concessionaire got out of its trinket-selling business, and the department store asked National Theme to take over. 
National Theme has been training managers in the display and sale of the glass items under the tutelage of a former Franklin Mint designer and marketing executive. 

   "Selling is our forte. 
It doesn't really matter if you're selling Halloween costumes or crystal," says National Theme Chairman Paul Thomas. 

   National Theme acknowledges, though, that selling crystal before Christmas is much more competitive, with specialty gift shops like Hallmark already having a stranglehold on trinket traffic. 
"Crystal is less of a must-buy than Halloween costumes," says John Poletto, vice president of operations for National Theme's crystal division. 
"But we already have a sales staff in place, and very good locations in the host stores that we're keeping from Halloween." 

   National Theme, which has found that its hottest Halloween costumes are the ones it designs itself, also hopes to apply that lesson to the crystal business. 
Next year it will add its own crystal and pewter line to the items on this year's shelves. 

   Company executives expect $5 million in crystal sales over the next two months. 
And by expanding the flow of revenue over other holidays, National Theme will gain a big advantage in financing. 
The company now must operate on a bank credit line for most of the year, then pay it down after Halloween. 

   "By September, we're on a negative cash flow, and the bank asks, 'How are you doing?' 
I say lousy, so far," jokes National Theme's president, Mr. Sullivan. 
"With this business, you have to be in it for the long haul."

   Boeing Co. said it received a $1.1 billion order for 22 commercial aircraft from Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services, the aircraft-leasing joint venture of the Australian concerns TNT Ltd. and News Corp. 

   The purchase includes 16 Boeing 757 airplanes, which seat about 220 passengers, and six 767-300 extended-range jetliners, which seat about 250. 
Ansett Worldwide also took options on an additional seven 767 aircraft. 

   Ansett selected Rolls-Royce PLC's RB211-535E4 engine for the 757s. 
Engine selection for the 767s will be announced later. 
Boeing, the Seattle-based aircraft and defense contracting concern, will begin delivering the 757s in October 1990, with further deliveries extending into 1995. 
Deliveries of the 767s will begin in October 1990 and continue through 1993. 

   Ansett Worldwide will have the right to substitute the standard -200 or -300 series for the 767 extended-range airplanes, in order to meet the requirements of the leasing market, Boeing said. 

   The transaction brings total orders for Boeing's 757 aircraft to 387, close to what industry obervers say is the break-even point of 400 orders for the 757 model. 
To date this year, 148 of the 757s have been ordered, compared with 37 a year earlier. 

   The Ansett Worldwide order brings total 767 orders to 353, with 76 ordered for the year to date, compared with 55 a year ago. 

   So far this year, a total of 595 Boeing jetliners of all models have been ordered, with a total value of $28 billion, compared with 321 airplanes valued at $16.5 billion for the same period last year. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares fell 75 cents to close at $60.875. 

   TNT is a transportation concern; News Corp. is Rupert Murdoch's media company.

<HL> Marketing &amp; Media: Coca-Cola, After an 11-Year Absence, Seeks to Re-Enter Huge Market in India </HL>

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co., which stalked out of India 11 years ago, is knocking on the door again. 

   Coke applied for permission to build a $3 million wholly owned plant in an export-processing zone near Delhi. 
The facility would produce substances needed to manufacture Coke concentrate. 
As much as 25% of the product could be sold in India, while the rest would have to be exported, to meet Indian regulations. 

   The Atlanta-based cola giant's move could foreshadow a turf war on the subcontinent since it follows by just two months rival PepsiCo Inc.'s announcement that it was starting a $17 million joint venture in India -- 39.9% owned by Pepsi -- despite tough restrictions imposed by the Indian government. 
Beyond that, the drive into India, with its 800 million people, appears to be an attempt by Coke to keep Pepsi from one day owning the Indian market. 
Coke currently outsells Pepsi by about 3.6 to 1 outside the U.S. 

   "I don't think Coke would like Pepsi to have exclusivity in that large a market," said Lee Wilder, an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co. 
A spokesman for Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., declined to comment on Coke's application. 

   The soft-drink industry is growing at a healthy 5% rate in the U.S., but it is expanding at about 16% elsewhere, said Jesse Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest. 
"India is high on everybody's target list," he said. 
"Soft drinks are going to be an important part of the Indian subcontinent." 

   Indians drink about 2.4 billion bottles of name-brand soft drinks a year. 
Although that's a small number on a per-capita basis, industry analysts estimate the market is growing at 20% annually. 
Neither Coke nor Pepsi products are being sold in India. 

   A Coke spokesman said the company believes its application complies with Indian regulations, but he refused to speculate about how long it might take before a decision is handed down. 
The only American cola maker selling in India said that could take time. 

   L. Edward Shanks, president and chief operating officer of closely held Double-Cola Co., said: "Take nothing for granted in India. 
This I am sure will be a big political issue, regardless of how well Coke has its ducks lined up." 
Double-Cola, which commands only about 1% of the U.S. soft-drink market from its base in Chattanooga, Tenn., set up franchises in India in 1987. 
It took the company six years to negotiate its entry. 

   Coke left India in 1977, after being there 27 years, when the government ruled that foreign companies couldn't own more than 40% of their Indian subsidiaries. 
The ruling would have required Coke to turn over the formula for its concentrate to its Indian partners. 
But, cola company officials said, the investment environment has improved recently for American companies and new rules make operating in the export-processing zone attractive. 
Coke, for example, could import key ingredients for its Indian production, thereby maintaining the secrecy of its concentrate formula. 

   Coke said that if its application is approved, production earmarked for domestic use could be sold to an Indian company that would produce finished concentrate, which could then be sold to Indian bottlers. 
Coke might want to hold a stake in any concentrate-completing company, the spokesman said. 

   While India is a huge potential market, analysts don't expect any operations there to affect Coke's earnings anytime soon. 
"India won't affect earnings estimates for the next three years, but it could be in the top 10 markets in the next 15 years," said Ms. Wilder.

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel imports for the first nine months of 1988 rose 8.2% from year-ago levels. 
But because of bolstered domestic shipments, foreign steel penetrated less of the U.S. market and thus approached the target set by President Reagan's import-restraint program, the American Iron and Steel Institute said. 

   The trade group said imports through the first three quarters rose to 16,072,000 net tons from 14,848,000 a year earlier. 
However, 1988 imports represented just 20.6% of the apparent supply in the U.S. market, compared with 21.2% in the 1987 period. 
The target of the president's controversial trade program, known as voluntary restraint agreements, or VRAs, is about 20.2%. 

   The institute's compilation of Commerce Department data also showed that imports rose 5.6% in September from yearearlier levels. 
Specifically, they climbed for the month to 1,648,000 net tons -- representing 19.7% of the U.S. market -- from 1,560,000 net tons a year earlier. 
In August, imports were 1,783,000 net tons. 

   Imports from developing nations and the European Economic Community surged year-to-year in September -- 16.5% and 13.6%, respectively. 
Imports from Japan fell 7.4% and imports from Canada fell 9.3% over the same stretch. 

   Separately, the American Institute for Imported Steel -- which, unlike the American Iron and Steel Institute, opposes the VRAs -- said it figured that steel imports for the first nine months fell below the targets set by the VRAs. 
The importers' trade association uses a different base number to make its calculations, excluding semifinished steel bound for U.S. mills.

   Toward the end of "Spoils of War," the new play at the Music Box Theater, playwright Michael Weller has written a harrowing, insightful scene that has the audience members on the edge of their seats. 

   Elise and Andrew are the divorced parents of 15-year-old Martin. 
Prior to World War II, Elise and Andrew were close comrades in a left-wing political group, as well as husband and wife. 
When Andrew returned from several years of wartime service, the two separated, politically as well as personally, and when we meet them, in the 1950s, they have moved even further apart. 

   Andrew (Jeffrey de Munn) has become a well-dressed, uptight commercial photographer with a new lady friend named Penny (Marita Geraghty). 
Elise (Kate Nelligan) is a flamboyant, free spirit who is becoming more rather than less unconventional. 
She drinks too much, cavalierly borrows merchandise from the high-fashion showroom where she works, and when given a choice between having the telephone or the electricity cut off for non-payment, unhesitatingly chooses the latter because, in her words, "Nothing unexpected ever came to me by way of the refrigerator." 

   Martin (Christopher Collet), the son, lives with his mother. 
He's devoted to her, but she drives him crazy with her unpredictable affection. 
Skimping on herself, she sends him away to the best boarding school she can find, but when parents' weekend rolls around she fails to show up despite repeated avowals to do so. 

   Martin's obsession is to bring his divorced parents together, and to this end he schemes endlessly. 
Finally, in the climactic scene of the play, he succeeds. 
Elise starts the scene with a bang when, upon meeting Penny, she remarks to Andrew, "You didn't used to settle for such small change." 

   The two combatants spar with one another while an anxious Martin hovers in the background. 
After a time, Elise and Andrew recall the old days: the political causes they shared and the chemistry between them. 
They laugh; Elise sings "I Saw You Last Night"; Martin, the cheerleader, tries to get them to dance together. 
Then the mood snaps; they are in the present again. 
Elise holds out empty arms, pleading with Andrew to fill them, but the chasm is too wide, the distance traveled in different directions too great. 
Elise humiliates Andrew; she starts to leave, demanding that Martin come with her, but he refuses. 
Martin's personal universe has been blown apart, never to come together in the same way again. 

   The scene is written with a combination of unbridled passion and sure-handed control: In the exchanges of the three characters and the rise and fall of emotions, Mr. Weller has captured the heartbreaking inexorability of separation. 

   Unfortunately, this scene occurs two hours into the play, and what goes before does not come close to matching it in intensity or insight. 
The play is supposed to operate on several levels: The spoils of the title refer to political wars and to World War II as well as the personal war between Elise and Andrew, but in most cases this is described rather than dramatized. 
Mr. Weller is a sensitive, observant writer and Ms. Nelligan, as Elise, is an authoritative actress with a strong stage presence, but neither the writer nor the star can give "Spoils of War" the dimension it achieves in its one climactic scene.

   Though not one of George Bernard Shaw's major plays, "The Devil's Disciple" is a delightful minor one, and it is being given an effervescent, thoroughly engaging production at the Circle in the Square Theater. 
Written in 1896, it has several historical distinctions: For one, it had its premiere not in England but in the U.S.; for another, it was Shaw's first hit. 

   Set in a New Hampshire village during the Revolutionary War, it is a melodrama that Shaw, in his inimitable fashion, turns upside down. 
Dick Dudgeon, the title character, is a religious rebel who is the bane of his strait-laced mother and his equally puritanical relatives. 
Among those shocked by Dick's irreverent attitude are the local minister, Anthony Anderson, and his wife, Judith, who declares so loudly and so often how much she detests Dick that we know from the start that she is madly in love with him. 

   Dick is having tea with the Andersons when Anthony is called away on an emergency. 
Several British soldiers crash in on Judith and Dick, assuming that the latter is the minister whom they have come to take away to be hanged. 
A hero despite himself, Dick decides to take the minister's place and marches off to the gallows. 
In the end, of course, Dick is not hanged and, in true Shavian style, both he and the minister discover that their true calling is the opposite of what they had always thought. 

   Along the way Shaw makes fun not only of religious hypocrisy and fanaticism but the British soldier. 
Gen. Burgoyne is commander of the British troops, and when Dick asks to be shot rather than hanged, the general points out that in view of the ineptitude and inaccuracy of British marksmen, hanging is far more merciful. 

   For the current revival director Stephen Porter has assembled a top-flight cast of actors who obviously are enjoying themselves as much as Shaw did. 
Roxanne Hart is a charmingly distraught minister's wife; Remak Ramsey is her marvelously stuffy husband; Philip Bosco is a knowing, witty Burgoyne; and Victor Garber is having a field day as Dick Dudgeon. 
It's a matinee idol's star turn, and Mr. Garber is making the most of it, combining bravado and good humor with a becoming modesty.

<HL> But a Major Question Remains: Which Plane Is Better Designed? </HL>
<AUTHOR> Roy J. Harris Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Testor Corp.'s F-19 Stealth fighter kit created quite a stir when it came out in 1986. 
The design of the plastic model -- supposed to resemble the sleek, black supersonic fighter then rumored to be one of the Air Force's most secret weapons -- was "based upon years of extensive research," the kit's instructions proclaimed. 

   Once, when Lockheed Corp., then rumored to be the plane's maker, was on the congressional griddle for security lapses, Rep. Ronald Wyden waved the Testor model in front of TV cameras to show that even kids knew what the company's hush-hush plane looked like. 
Lockheed officials, as always on questions about the existence of a Stealth fighter, were mute. 

   But now it's time for Testor to be a bit quieter. 
Its Stealth fighter, it turns out, doesn't look much at all like the stubby, batlike plane pictured in the Air Force's press release last week acknowledging for the first time the plane's existence. 
Testor's plane doesn't even have the right name. 
The real Stealth is designated the F-117A, not F-19. 

   "Anyone who has two eyes can see the resemblance is fleeting at best," concedes John Dewey, a spokesman for Testor in Rockford, Ill. 
He says the F-19 models won't be recalled from model-shop shelves, but adds: "We certainly don't anticipate any big production runs in the future." 

   John Andrews, the designer of the Testor F-19, says his work wasn't ever advertised as the real thing. 
And as for turning out a model based on the picture of the F-117A, "we just don't feel what has been released at this point in time is enough to go on." 
That also goes for the Northrop Corp. B-2 Stealth bomber scheduled to be shown for the first time next week, he says. 
The next Stealth model "had better be accurate" if model builders are going to buy it, Mr. Andrews says. 

   Still, Testor sees some silver linings in the experience. 
It sold 800,000 copies of the F-19 at about $10 each -- more than 10 times the sales of the company's previous best seller. 
And, ironically, if model fans really want something that looks more like the F-117A Stealth, Testor offers a Soviet Stealth fighter model that the company claims is fairly close to the Lockheed plane. 

   Anyway, Mr. Dewey says, if the F-19 had been too close to the real thing, "there'd have been guys with trench coats (all) over us."

<HL> Japan Launches Bid for Reagan to Lift Trade Sanctions on Electronic Products </HL>

   Japan is launching a last-ditch effort to persuade the Reagan administration, during its last weeks in power, to lift trade sanctions against Japanese electronic products. 

   Tokyo this week began presenting arguments to administration officials that it is doing sufficiently well in guaranteeing U.S. semiconductor chip makers access to its market to justify removal of punitive U.S. tariffs, imposed by President Reagan last year, against $165 million of Japanese laptop computers and other products. 

   The U.S. share of Japan's chip market has increased only slightly, even Tokyo concedes. 
But in making its last-minute appeal, Japan is contending that alternate ways of measuring U.S. success in the market make things look better. 

   A senior administration official said the new Japanese argument will be studied seriously, and might win the support of the State Department. 
But he predicted it would be fiercely opposed by trade officials, and he concluded the odds are against any lifting of the sanctions. 

   Still, President Reagan has gone against the advice of his own trade specialists on two occasions and lifted parts of the sanctions, which initially covered $300 million of Japanese products. 
The Japanese are hoping that the president, who philosophically opposes trade retaliation, will be inclined to "tidy up the mess before he leaves office," said a U.S. lawyer who is advising Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI. 

   The administration also is hearing strong appeals from U.S. chip makers to hang tough, though. 

   The U.S. contends that Tokyo implicitly promised, in a side letter to a 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement, to provide U.S. companies 20% of the domestic Japanese chip market. 

   In a letter sent this week to senior U.S. trade officials, the MITI conceded that the U.S. share of the Japanese market grew only modestly to 10.7% last summer from 8.5% when the pact was concluded. 
But the MITI said U.S. sales have been booming in absolute terms. 
It reported that these sales surged to $465 million in the 1988 second quarter from $274 million a year earlier. 

   In addition, the MITI claimed that the number of "design-ins," or Japanese decisions to buy U.S. chips for products still on the drawing board, has nearly doubled to 641 in the past six months. 
Among such arrangements reported by the MITI are Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s purchase of partly customized chips from Texas Instruments Inc. for videocassette recorders, and Sony Corp.'s purchase of Motorola Inc. microprocessors for eight-millimeter video cameras. 

   Hitachi Ltd. also has decided to use Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s latest products, while Toyota Motor Corp. is discussing with Motorola joint development of microprocessors for automotive applications, the MITI letter said. 

   The letter was signed by Shigeo Muraoka, the Japanese vice minister for international affairs. 
MITI Minister Hajime Tamura could follow it with a personal appeal to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and Commerce Secretary William Verity, MITI aides said. 

   Moreover, Tokyo contends that the 1986 side letter was merely a recognition of U.S. market-access objectives and not a firm commitment to give U.S. vendors 20% of the Japanese market. 
That letter, which was signed by Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, stated that the attainment of this goal depends on "competitive factors," the "sales efforts" of U.S. vendors, the "purchasing efforts" of Japanese buyers, and the "efforts of both governments." 

   Donald Phillips, the U.S. assistant trade representative for industry, will assess the Japanese case in bilateral talks today and tomorrow. 

   Any decision to ease the sanctions would provoke a sharp protest from U.S. chip makers. 
Indeed, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S. industry lobby group, has urged the White House to raise the stakes in the trade dispute by denying Japanese chip makers permanent protection for their chip designs. 
In a letter sent this week to the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office, Semiconductor Industry Association President Andrew Procassini argued that a 1984 law gives the White House discretion to deny such rights to a country that fails to give "reciprocal market access" to U.S. vendors. 

   Under the law, chip makers in Japan qualified for interim protection, because their government adopted an equivalent law in 1985. 
But such protection could lapse in 1991, unless the White House issues a proclamation granting Japanese chip makers permanent protection, according to lawyers for the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf: Literary Shake-Up </HL>
<AUTHOR> Carol Iannone </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Asked to edit the 1988 entry in the annual "Best American Short Stories" series, fiction writer Mark Helprin decided to shake things up. 
He has. 

   In his bracing, witty, two-fisted introduction to the 20 stories he has chosen for this collection (Houghton Mifflin, 345 pages, $17.95), Mr. Helprin lays out the current literary scene with combative honesty. 
In the university, he says, literature has become hostage to those who must politicize it into questions of "race, sex, and economics" because they have not the soul to apprehend its surpassing truths. (It is now presupposed in departments of English, for example, that a black woman "is unable to find anything of lasting value in Shakespeare" because he was a "white male.") 

   The literary environment has been further devastated by the seeping poison of minimalists, purveyors of spare, uninvolved fiction that documents the banality and pointlessness of existence. 
According to Mr. Helprin, the minimalists "appear to start from the premise that the world has unjustly offended their innate virtue and forced them to become trenchant, impassive observers of its universal offensiveness." 
Actually, in his eyes, they are cowards before the risks and challenges of life who have made a "virtual industry" out of ridiculing "effort, perfection, devotion, fidelity, honor, belief, love, bravery." 
They have created instead an airless, "anaerobic" fiction that expresses nothing but their own spiritual exhaustion. 

   Mr. Helprin also healthfully excoriates our writing-school fiction factories ("It is simply not possible to teach someone to write"); the sorry condition of the publishing industry ("Publishers put out the most astonishing junk with the excuse that the public wants it, and the public receives the junk with the excuse that it is what the publishers provide"); and the compromised state of much current reviewing ("There is . . . an incredible traffic in favors, and accounts are kept as if in ledgers"). 

   But even while surveying this blighted landscape, Mr. Helprin unabashedly begins to reclaim some of the hallowed ground that literature once occupied. 

   Nowhere do truth and beauty "run together with such complexity and power as in the gracefully written word," he declares, and there is much in this collection that pulls us toward that sacred space where the power of the word is wielded with purpose, effect and consequence. 

   Of course, even Mr. Helprin's writers must confront, at least to some extent, the minimalist world of breakup, dissolution, disappointment, confusion and loss. 
They must, after all, give literary expression to an unraveling society. 
But for the most part, Mr. Helprin's authors do not hide behind minimalist affectlessness. 
For example, the story of a dissolving marriage, Richard Bausch's "Police Dreams," is unapologetically weighted with the anxiety and humiliation a husband feels when his wife coarsely and selfishly rejects him. 

   In "Wonderland," by C.S. Godshalk, a single mother temporarily abandons her two sons. 
The older boy struggles to keep the "family" together. 
He is at once enraged and baffled, determined to be tough but also feeling helpless and hurt. 
He is presented by the author with dry-eyed compassion. 

   Not all the stories are about intense suffering of this kind. 
In Lucy Honig's "No Friends, All Strangers," the daily subway ride that the protagonist must take becomes a framework that serves to unite the story's fragmented perceptions. 
Sometimes an almost Joycean moment of insight or release redeems a tale of anguish or regret. 
In Mary Ann Taylor-Hall's "Banana Boats," an old woman moves toward self-knowledge as she confronts the gradual failure that has marked her life. 
In Richard Currey's "Waiting for Trains," a lonely Vietnam veteran wonders "how things begin, how anything finds a first moment and drives out of . . . darkness into . . . life." 
But then he experiences a brush with danger that seems to set him free. 
In the harshly muscular "Helping," by Robert Stone, yet another Vietnam vet pushes himself to an alcoholic bottom from which he begins to perceive his need for forgiveness. 

   Some of the writers unfold their stories in flashback. 
The act of reconstructing the past can supply an aesthetic depth unavailable in the infantile, faceless presentness of minimalism. 
By telling his amusing adolescent tale, "Smorgasbord," from an adult viewpoint, Tobias Wolff incorporates a level of subtle understanding that locates loss of innocence in letting "the light go out" of feeling, passion and commitment. 
In Marjorie Sandor's evocatively written "Still Life," a woman sifting through old photographs explores the essence of her romantic, full-spirited but somehow mysterious "Tante Rose." 

   If not every story in the collection can lay claim to distinction (at 20 stories a year, 2,000 stories a century, this would be impossible under any circumstances), it is clear that on the whole Mr. Helprin's selection has enabled us to enjoy literature in refreshing ways, both new and old. 

   Furthermore, he has reminded us that even in an unstable or deracinated society, the literary voice can be a cohesive force, if writers have the courage to resist entropy and to exert the redemptive potency of their profession.

<HL> Who's News: Xerox to Lose Its Legal Chief To Law Firm </HL>
<AUTHOR> Amy Dockser (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> XRX WNEWS </CO>
<TEXT>
   Robert S. Banks, regarded in legal circles as the chief architect of the modern corporate law department, is leaving his post as general counsel of Xerox Corp. 

   His destination will have some lawyers scratching their heads: He is moving to an outside law firm to train in-house general counsel to cut costs and deal more effectively with outside law firms. 

   Mr. Banks, 54, will undertake his new practice as counsel at the New York office of Latham &amp; Watkins, a Los Angeles law firm with more than 50 lawyers. 

   Under his two-year contract with the firm, which begins Jan. 1, Mr. Banks will offer his services to corporate legal departments -- and, while he's at it, try to persuade them to install a document-management system made by Xerox that he contends will help them slash their legal costs. 
If the clients decide to buy the computers, Xerox sales representatives will take over and negotiate a deal. 

   Mr. Banks says that he and Xerox have not yet worked out how, or if, he will be compensated when a corporate department purchases a Xerox system. 
But as part of the arrangement, Xerox has agreed to install its document-management computer system in Mr. Banks's office at Latham. 

   Clinton R. Stevenson, Latham &amp; Watkins's managing partner for more than 20 years, is relinquishing managerial responsibilities to work with Mr. Banks on his project. 
"For corporate law departments, it is a unique opportunity to get both sides of the picture, from a manager of a law firm and a manager of an in-house department," says Mr. Stevenson. 

   Mr. Banks, who is taking early retirement from Xerox, joined that company in 1967 as a senior antitrust attorney after a six-year stint with Du Pont Co.'s legal department. 
Named head of Xerox's law department in 1976, he pioneered the use of a variety of cost-cutting innovations that are now standard practice among in-house lawyers. 

   He also co-founded in 1981 the American Corporate Counsel Association. 
The organization, which now has 7,500 members, has helped improve the stature of in-house lawyers, who have traditionally been perceived as somewhat inferior to their counterparts at law firms. 

   Mr. Banks says he has long been frustrated by that notion. 
When he joined Xerox, in-house lawyers were required to submit any work to the outside attorneys for approval. 
As far back as law school, a professor had discouraged his ambitions to join a corporate law department, recalls Mr. Banks. 
"Why don't you want to practice law?" 
Mr. Banks says the Cornell law professor asked. 

   When he became Xerox's general counsel, Mr. Banks says he immediately set out "to change the idea that in-house lawyers were second-class citizens and paper shufflers." 
He adds, "Corporations need strong in-house lawyers." 

   Mr. Banks proved to be just that. 
Six months after his appointment at Xerox, he rejected the advice of outside counsel to settle a costly antitrust suit filed by SCM Corp. that alleged that Xerox had monopolized the plain-paper copier market. 
Mr. Banks persuaded Xerox's then-Chairman Peter McColough to go to trial. 
A jury awarded SCM $37.3 million in damages, but the judge set aside the award and an appeals court in 1981 upheld the judge's decision. 

   Once the SCM case ended, Mr. Banks turned his attention in-house."Bob was the first to argue that legal fees should be viewed as another cost of business, and that like any business cost they can be controlled," says Nancy Nord, executive director of the corporate counsel association. 

   He began by reducing his own staff by 15%. 
He also widened the scope of the lawyers' responsibilities and took more cases in-house. 
To attract top-quality lawyers, he created an eight-year "partnership" track comparable to those at outside law firms and began recruiting at law schools. 
He also urged the lawyers to join professional organizations and offer free legal services for the needy. 

   When outside firms were used, recalls Deputy General Counsel Richard S. Paul, Mr. Banks insisted that Xerox lawyers control the direction of the case. 
He also began requiring that outside firms submit budgets and quarterly reports. 
If they wanted to exceed their budgets, outside firms had to get in-house authorization. 

   But computerization of the department turned out to be the biggest money-saver, Mr. Banks says. 
In 1981 he provided computers to his top eight lawyers and refused to communicate with them except via computer. 

   Today every Xerox lawyer has a computer. 
The computerization of such tasks as distribution of documents to all lawyers on the Xerox team, retrieval of documents, and document storage that allows the lawyers to build on past work has saved $15 million in legal fees this year, Mr. Banks estimates. 

   Mr. Banks hopes that this record will persuade corporate general counsel to retain him. 
"I know CEOs are after general counsel to be more productive, to keep their costs down," he says. 
"I can show them how to do it."

<HL> Politics &amp; Policy: Sununu, Bush's Likely Choice as Chief of Staff, Would Bring Fervent Conservative Views to Post </HL>

<TEXT>
   For the past six years, the last thing Gov. John Sununu has seen as he left his Statehouse office has been the official portrait of former Gov. Sherman Adams, who went to Washington as President Eisenhower's chief of staff. 

   Now President-elect George Bush appears ready to announce that Mr. Sununu is following Mr. Adams to Washington as White House chief of staff. 

   Mr. Bush's probable selection of the outspoken, sometimes unpredictable New Hampshire governor would bring a fervent conservative voice to the Bush White House. 
Mr. Sununu would likely serve as a rallying point for conservatives seeking to move Mr. Bush to the right. 

   Moreover, Mr. Sununu also could become an ideological counterweight to two other influential voices in the new administration -- the more-pragmatic James Baker, the new secretary of state, and Richard Darman, the likely director of the Office of Management and Budget. 

   There still is a chance that Mr. Bush may decide against appointing Mr. Sununu to the White House job. 
Mr. Bush's major advisers -- Messrs. 
Baker and Darman, his pollster Robert Teeter, and his vice presidential chief of staff Craig Fuller -- are known to be unhappy with the choice of Mr. Sununu. 
Among other things, the four are thought to view Mr. Sununu as a rival to their influence. 
The appointment of Mr. Sununu, who is Lebanese-American, also deeply troubles Jewish leaders, who consider him an ally of pro-Arab causes. 
They worry that Mr. Sununu might seek to dilute the U.S. commitment to Israel. 

   Mr. Sununu told a news conference here that "a request isn't a formal request until the tall, thin guy sings. 
And the tall thin guy hasn't sung publicly." 
Also Mr. Bush said "no formal decisions" had been made. 
But high-ranking transition officials said they don't know of any reason to doubt the Sununu appointment. 

   Mr. Sununu's appointment would be the latest step in an extraordinary political career. 
Cuban-born but reared and educated in the U.S., he became a mechanical engineer before ascending to the governor's office of perhaps America's most frugal and idiosyncratic state. 
He is, moreover, a devout conservative and supply-sider who confounded political analysts when he endorsed Mr. Bush two years ago over a field of well-credentialed conservatives. 
He confounded them again when he put Mr. Bush on the road to the White House by engineering the vice president's comeback in the New Hampshire primary. 

   Gruff, blunt, steely intelligent and impatient of the totems of politics, Mr. Sununu would become the most exclusive manager in the nation. 

   But those who know the 49-year-old governor believe he would do more than cooly run the White House bureaucracy. 
He would try to fashion not only the Bush team but the Bush presidency as well. 
"Assuming the debate shifts from the pledge of allegiance and the American Civil Liberties Union," says former Republican Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, "Sununu will have lots of ideas of how to shape a Bush agenda." 

   The three-term New Hampshire governor foresees a "bland, low-key transition," dominated by Bush loyalists and not by the denizens of Washington's K Street corridor of consultants. 
And he says that the appointments Mr. Bush will make will stress continuity with the Reagan administration, not brave departures. 

   "This is not a hostile takeover," he said over a mug of apple pumpkin soup in his office here. 
"It is a natural progression, a comfortable procession." 

   The man who might preside over the first natural, inter-party White House transition since Calvin Coolidge gave way to Herbert Hoover 60 years ago is one part academic, one part ideological warrior and one part systems analyst. 

   "He's a master at analyzing systems and seeing how large organizations work," says Thomas Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general. 
"But anybody who thinks that all he's going to do is analyze is mistaken. 
He is a visceral, emphatic participant. 
He won't only generate solutions for problems, but become an advocate for them." 

   As governor, Mr. Sununu took a state bureaucracy and a state accounting system better suited to the era of Franklin Pierce, who in 1853 became the state's only president, and gave them an efficient, high-tech edge that matched the partisan edge Mr. Sununu lent to many of his efforts. 
He was a hands-on governor with hands-on expertise at the computer terminal. 

   "He became an extremely powerful figure in a state where the powers of the governor are not great," says Richard Winters, a Dartmouth College expert on state politics. 
"He knows how to marshall all the fragments and shards of executive authority. 
He doesn't shy from the hardball politics, but he also masters the details." 

   Mr. Bush's choice of the New Hampshire governor would suggest that he wants a tough, aggressive administration. 
Mr. Sununu is also known as partisan and acerbic. 

   "His biggest asset is his biggest liability," says Ned Helms, a Democratic activist who served as commissioner of health and human services under Gov. Sununu. 
"He's very, very bright, but sometimes he's so taken with his own brilliance that he doesn't pull out the best in other people." 

   Mr. Sununu, who has no Washington experience, emphasizes the need for conciliation -- with Democrats, with Congress, with various elements of the party, including conservatives, who didn't embrace the Bush campaign with enthusiasm. 

   Mr. Sununu believes Mr. Bush will nominate cabinet members and leading administration officials who will carry the Reagan philosophy to its next stage. 
"There's no rush to change direction," says Gov. Sununu. 
"He's building on what's there rather than reversing directions." 

   But he envisions Mr. Bush adopting a different approach to the presidency than Mr. Reagan's. 
"He has a different style than Reagan, one that has two apparently contradictory pieces," Mr. Sununu says. 
"He'll bring good people in and delegate more responsibility to them. 
But he'll also give himself more involvement and responsibility." 

   Gov. Sununu says Mr. Bush has his own rhythms and impulses and will put his own distinct stamp on the White House. 
"Here's a man who had the self confidence and personal discipline not to be stampeded into a campaign agenda," Mr. Sununu says. 
"Everyone was panicking when Dukakis had his 17-point lead. 
People wanted quick action . . . 
He'll take a measured approach." 

   But he says he expects Mr. Bush to undertake an effort to solidify his ties on Capitol Hill. 

   "Between now and January 20th, there has to be strong eforts to begin to develop a working relationship with Congress," he says. 
"He has a personal relationship with most of Congress, but now he's got to convert that to a presidential working relationship. 
It takes a transition for both groups, and I think the initiative ought to be his." 

   Now Mr. Sununu is about to pass the oil portrait of Sherman Adams for the last time. 
He leaves the governor's office with regret -- and without being able to pass up a final jibe at his "bete noire," Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. 

   "This is the greatest job in the world," he says and then, in a reference to his own successes as governor, adds, "I've done what many governors have run around the country saying they've done."

   Richard Dennis was national co-chairman of Bruce Babbitt's presidential campaign. 

   A few years back I had the opportunity to meet the eminent professor of free-market economies, Friedrich Hayek. 
At this meeting he advanced a startling idea -- that I might be interested in creating a private currency. 
He had heard that I was involved in the commodities business and figured that somebody with an alleged expertise in the pricing of real assets could create a currency backed by a basket of assets. 
This currency could be used instead of the fiat money that governments currently print. 

   The whole project seemed somewhat beyond the realm of possibility and I decided to leave it as a theoretical discussion. 
It was not clear to me how it would work, but it was clear that there would be severe dislocations to the economy if a private currency existed that could compete with, and in fact might be superior to, our currency. 

   A few years later I had some experience in California real estate. 
I was left to ponder why there seemed to be a chronic gap between the amounts one could garner in rent for high-profile property and the higher, thus uneconomic, cost of that real estate. 
Now that this phenomenon has spread to Japan, Honolulu and Manhattan, in addition to Southern California, it is now clear that this was not some temporary event that would be eliminated by a greater supply of real estate or a higher price for rents. 
In addition, these fancy prices cannot be explained simply as lavish consumption since they do not reduce the net worth of the buyer. 

   Unfortunately for conventional economic theory, and probably for the economy as a whole, what Mr. Hayek had conceived, people have created. 
A new type of money has been invented. 
It is select real estate. 
It is an asset that serves as an apparent store of value. 
It is an asset whose price is far in excess of its income-producing capability. 
The economy has developed a black hole into which savings are disappearing. 
It raises interest rates just as if the money had disappeared. 
Narrow money measures will be the same, but the value of all paper assets in portfolios will shrink. 
In fact, the value of all productive assets will fall, just as if people were putting their money under their pillows. 

   This flight to exotic real estate is the mechanism by which people withdraw equity from the normal economy of consumption and savings and the reason why interest rates tend to rise faster than inflation. 
This flight is why inflationary growth will not work. 
This is why renouncing deficits, making hard deficit choices and stabilizing the money supply (what has been called austerity) will actually result in stimulating the economy, both short term and long term. 
By shattering the inflationary worries of investors, the embrace of austerity will cause interest rates to fall with good near-term effects that outweigh the loss of demand cut out of the budget (a 2% drop in interest rates would effectively mean $80 billion in added demand and profitability in the economy based on about $4 trillion in business and household debt). 
Simply, lower interest rates are money in debtors' pockets, and that is a stimulus to growth. 

   Choosing austerity also has clear long-term benefits, if it includes a theological recantation of demand-side economics. 
We need to end the government's national experiment with half-loaf Keynesian policies. 
Half of Keynes's policy was about stimulating a down economy with deficits, the other half, the forgotten half, was about flattening out the boom cycle by running surpluses and raising taxes. 
It is now clear that what worked brilliantly in the textbooks has brought us to ruin in practice. 
Deficits have proven politically irreversible and parent to ruinously high real interest rates. 

   Individuals mete out their own brand of austerity to the economy when the deficit drives them to invest in real estate as a store of value. 
The real economic question we face is how to bring them back to the real economy. 
They implicitly demand "austerity" and an end to deficits as the price. 
Their ranks grow every day. 
That is why only austerity can stimulate the economy. 
We are liable to get less government "austerity" the more we veer toward a recession. 
This would be a disaster. 
It would drive real interest rates even higher in the midst of a recession. 
It would risk a depression. 
This nightmare scenario is avoidable only if we start by asking the right question. 
And so far, we are not.

   Peter G. Peterson is an investment banker who chairs the Institute for International Economics and the Council on Foreign Relations. 

   To begin with, George Bush should institute a revolutionary principle: truth in budgeting. 
We now foolishly depend on foreign lenders and central banks for a staggering $150 billion a year; in turn, their confidence, for starters, depends on our honesty. 
Let's just say no to Panglossian arithmetic. 
No more OMB projections that assume 4 1/2% 10-year Treasury bonds in 1993 -- which are supposed to "reduce" that year's deficit by something approaching $100 billion. 
No more double counting of another $100 billion -- those huge projected Social Security retirement surpluses; such double counting simply masks our growing non-Social Security budget deficit. 
And no more ignoring the exploding cost and impending insolvency of Medicare. 

   Honest and prudent accounting -- and the goal of getting the non-Social Security deficit down to 1%-2% of GNP by 1993 -- suggests some combination of annual spending cuts and revenue increases that total about $125 billion to $150 billion a year by 1993. 
If the financial markets saw a credible, structural deficit reduction in place, long-term real interest rates just might fall by two percentage points or more -- all of which would make the balance of the required deficit reduction of $40 billion to $50 billion far more attainable and less painful. 
Lower interest rates would also help stimulate a long-overdue investment revival and give the Fed desperately needed running room. 

   As for spending cuts, which in my view are at the very heart of this deficit matter over any reasonable period, let's dispense with all the easy talk of "quick," "huge" defense cuts. 
Defense burden sharing, for example, has become the newest cliche. 
But if we think we can safely get $50 billion or more annually in the next few years we may be dangerously naive: The indispensable negotiations with our allies and, in particular, with Mikhail Gorbachev will be tantalizing but torturous. 
Besides, less than 40% (or about $105 billion) of the defense budget consists of procurement, testing and R&amp;D -- the only areas in which substantial savings have been seriously proposed. 
Indeed, the "bow-wave" effect of procurement decisions already made could overwhelm efforts to cut defense procurement below current levels. 
Significantly, during the 1987 budget summit, the difference between the defense-budget "bid" of the "dovish" Democrats and the "ask" of the "hawkish" Republicans was only about $7 billion. 
Domestic politics demands that defense share in the deficit-reduction burden, but I'd say we'd be lucky to get more than 0.25% to 0.5% of the GNP below current levels. 

   This essentially leaves us with a $450 billion no-man's land -- the politically untouchable "unmentionables," the middle-class non-means-tested entitlements. 
Our rapidly aging society, the COLA multiplier and the health-care cost explosion threaten to double these entitlement outlays as a share of the GNP by 2025. (Unless we provide the investment resources to make our much smaller work force more productive, do we really think they can or will support a much larger retired population?) 
For those who prefer tax increases to fund these entitlement programs -- I certainly don't -- the required increase would be about 20 times the size of the net federal revenue cuts between 1979 and 1986. 
Speaking of the politically impossible, has anyone bothered to tell our kids about that? 

   If that constructive ambiguity -- "the flexible freeze" -- were to include the entitlement COLAs (except for the poor), that alone would commend it. 
A bit later, a "diet" COLA (e.g., 60% of the consumer price index) for the non-poor could save more than $100 billion annually by the year 2000. 

   Yes, if they were linked with iron to large structural spending cuts, I would support the right kind of tax increases. 
Given the lowest oil prices in years and the near-unanimous consensus that oil-import dependence is heading up dangerously over the next decade, there could not be a better time for a 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax (phased in over five years at 10 cents a year), which would produce $50 billion in annual revenue by 1993. 
And, since those of us who are well-off must show a willingness to have our ox gored, let's step up and admit that it is obscene for us to be getting back far more in Social Security retirement and health-care benefits than the value of our contributions -- and much of this is unfairly exempt from our income-tax system. 
Taxing this welfare for the well-off could produce real revenue (easily more than $20 billion a year by 1993). 

   As to the future-oriented agenda for which there probably is an electoral mandate -- for example child care, better schools, computer literacy and training the underclass -- these sorts of budgetary reforms would free up some budgetary resources that any solution, whether conservative or liberal, will require. 
And, these reforms would also demonstrate that entitlement and structural-deficit reform can go together: They are not the "Draconian," "impossible" remedies that conventional wisdom makes them out to be.

<HL> Who's News: Craig Takes Prime Computer Helm Early As Board Sets Decision on Bid by Nov. 29 </HL>

   Prime Computer Inc.'s Anthony L. Craig had planned to ease himself gradually into Prime's driver's seat. 
Now that seat is hot and, as of yesterday, he is in it. 

   Prime, the target of a hostile tender offer, accelerated a previously announced management transition and named Mr. Craig president and chief executive officer. 
The Natick, Mass., computer maker said the executive change was prompted by MAI Basic Four Inc.'s $20-a-share, or $970 million, offer for Prime, announced Tuesday. 

   Separately, Prime said it advised its shareholders to defer any decision on MAI's offer until Prime's board makes a recommendation on it. 
Prime added that its board will publicize its position on the offer on or before Nov. 29. 

   Mr. Craig, 43 years old, succeeds Joe M. Henson, 55, who said last month he planned to quit within a few months. 
At that time, Prime said Mr. Craig, formerly head of General Electric Co.'s Information Services division, would succeed Mr. Henson and named him to the posts of executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
Prime didn't immediately name a successor to Mr. Craig in those posts. 

   Mr. Henson said he had planned to remain as Prime's president until the end of the year, but MAI's offer "makes it desirable to complete the transition now, so Prime can be represented by the man who will have responsibility for leading it in the future." 
Mr. Henson added that he will continue as a consultant to Prime. 

   Mr. Craig declined to be interviewed yesterday. 

   Little known on Wall Street, he worked at International Business Machines Corp. for 17 years in various sales and marketing posts before joining GE in 1983. 
He is credited with reversing a five-year revenue decline at GE Information Services but was suddenly demoted in September to the position of "consultant" to a GE vice chairman, possibly because GE learned he was talking to Prime. 

   GE didn't return phone calls yesterday, but in the past has declined to comment. 

   Besides dealing with MAI's offer, Mr. Craig's mission at Prime probably will be to "strengthen directions it already is taking," said Bruce Jenkins, an analyst with Daratech, a Cambridge, Mass., market research firm. 
Prime, which faces sluggish sales in its minicomputer market, is putting increased emphasis on the faster-growing market for computer-aided design, or CAD, equipment. 

   Separately, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said that it has issued its commitment to provide as much as $412.5 million in senior debt financing for MAI's offer. 
Canadian Imperial said its commitment represents half of the total senior debt financing required for the proposed acquisition. 
It added that it is confident, under current market conditions, that it can arrange a syndicate of other banks to provide the balance of senior debt financing required for the bid. 

   MAI, a computer maker based in Tustin, Calif., is controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow. 

   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Prime shares fell 75 cents to close at $17, while MAI stock fell 37.5 cents to close at $11. 

   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed its Baa-3 rating on Prime's subordinated debt and its Ba-2 rating of Prime's Computervision Corp. unit's subordinated debt under review for possible downgrade. 
Moody's said about $475 million of debt is affected. 
Moody's added that its review will focus on MAI's plan for financing Prime's acquisition and on "the possible long-term effect of a change in management on Prime's user base." 

   Regarding the Moody's action, a Prime spokesman said, "It's almost a pro forma thing, given the circumstances." 
He declined to comment further.

<HL> Marketing: Coke Unveils Compact Dispenser, Hoping To Sell More Soft Drinks in Small Offices </HL>

   Coca-Cola Co. is mounting an assault on that venerable office institution: the water cooler. 

   Coke, naturally, would rather see employees gathering and gossiping around a Coca-Cola dispenser. 
So the company is introducing a compact machine, called BreakMate, that chills water, carbonates it, mixes it with Coca-Cola syrup and dispenses it into a 6 1/2-ounce cup. 

   The soft drink giant has been test-marketing BreakMate in small offices in 30 U.S. cities and overseas. 
It is now starting a national rollout of the machine, to be completed by the middle of next year. 
Coca-Cola won't say how much it has spent on BreakMate, the result of a project that started nearly 20 years ago. 
The company says only that the machine is one of the most expensive research and development projects it has ever undertaken. 

   W. Andrew Harvill, director of packaging and distribution development for Coke's fountain-sales division, says BreakMate "takes a giant leap forward" by enabling the company to reach places that are too small or unprofitable for a regular vending machine. 
"This could do for Coke what the microprocessor did for computers." 

   That's a grand vision, but some competitors aren't overly concerned. 
"It's interesting," says an executive at another big soft drink company. 
"We're watching it. 
But it isn't something I ask my guys to report on every week." 

   Although Coca-Cola denies it, some soft drink specialists believe BreakMate is a forerunner of a dispenser that will one day provide Coke, like tap water, in the home. 
"This is a Mr. Soda unit," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade publication Beverage Digest. 
Mr. Meyers says he knows of five other big-name companies currently developing similar machines. 
"This is the opening salvo in home soft drink distribution -- Cola Wars III." 

   BreakMate is part of Coca-Cola's age-old strategy of making its soft drinks available in every possible nook and cranny of the world -- "within arm's reach of desire," as the company's longtime chief executive officer, the late Robert W. Woodruff, used to say. 
The theory behind the strategy: If it's there, people will drink it. 

   "With soft drinks, there is no pucker factor, as there is with juice," says Mr. Meyers. 
"And there are no ill effects, as there are with alcohol. 
If it is available, it will be consumed." 
As evidence of this strategy's success, soft drink consumption surpassed water consumption in the U.S. two years ago and now stands at about 45 gallons a person per year, according to some industry estimates. 

   But many workplaces have been largely untapped by soft drink companies. 
A soft drink vending machine is only profitable where there are at least 45 employees, according to Coca-Cola's research. 
As a result, the more than one million offices around the country with fewer than 45 workers have no ready access to soft drinks. 
Even in many big offices, vending machines are a long walk or an elevator ride from many departments. 
But Coke says BreakMate can be profitable in offices or departments with as few as five workers. 

   Coke isn't the first soft drink company to try to reach smaller offices. 
Two years ago, PepsiCo Inc. introduced 24-can minivending machines that can be mounted on a wall or sit on a countertop. 
"It has been a healthy business for us," says a Pepsi spokeswoman. 
But it hasn't exactly run away with the market. 
The small machines have increased by 10% Pepsi's overall vending business, which itself accounts for 10% of the company's total soft drink business. 

   Pepsi says it hasn't tried to introduce an office fountain machine such as BreakMate because of "issues of sanitation, service, mixing and maintenance," the spokeswoman says. 
"How will you get over those hurdles of having volunteers operating that equipment?" 

   Attempts by several other companies to crack the market have failed either because they required office workers to mix their own syrup and water or because distribution of just a few cans to many places was too cumbersome, recalls John Farquharson, president of Araserv, a food service concern that distributes coffee and refreshment services to offices. 

   Coca-Cola believes it has solved those problems. 
BreakMate, which is about the size of a microwave oven, contains three disposable canisters of syrup, each with enough for about 31 drinks. 
The machine also holds a cartridge of carbon dioxide good for about 250 drinks. 
These containers, which snap into place, can be replaced by office workers when they run out. 

   If the machine can't be connected to an outside water supply, it can be fitted with a water tank. 
BreakMate does all the measuring, mixing and dispensing. 
Workers either put coins into the machines or have the soft drinks paid for by their employers. 

   The machines are made by a West German appliance company, a joint venture of Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. and Siemens AG, and Coca-Cola provides the soft drink syrup. 
BreakMates are being distributed by BreakTime Enterprises, a Coca-Cola spinoff, through office coffee services, bottled-water operators, vending companies and bottlers, who regularly visit offices. 

   Araserv, one of its largest customers during the test-marketing, says its customers have been pleased. 
They've even accepted what might not fit into every office decor: the bright red Coke logo.

   To Palestinians in Israel's occupied territories, the achievements of this week's Palestine National Council meeting in Algiers are clear enough: At a forum more democratic-looking than anything else in the Arab world, their representatives managed to unite behind a political statement that many nations are interpreting as a big step toward moderation. 

   But to the Israelis, the PNC's achievement is extremely worrying. 
In their view, a terrorist organization bent on Israel's destruction has duped gullible outsiders. 

   "Our main problem is that the world media is understanding the outcome of the PNC as recognition of Israel," says Alon Liel, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry. 
"Public opinion is already quite formed about it." 

   The Palestine National Council, a 450-member body representing Palestinian political factions and professional organizations, decides policy for the Palestine Liberation Organization. 

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has called for a "political war" to counter the impression that the PLO has significantly changed its policy. 
The government already has produced a blizzard of material contending that the PNC's acceptance of United Nations resolutions 242 and 338 doesn't constitute recognition of the Jewish state. 
It dispatched a position paper to all foreign embassies, hoping to forestall any more moves such as Turkey's recognition of the independent state of Palestine, proclaimed Tuesday in Algiers. 

   While many Arab and Moslem governments have, as expected, recognized the national state, Turkey is the first state with diplomatic relations with Israel to do so. 
Egypt, which also has diplomatic ties with Israel, welcomed the Palestinian state without recognizing it. 

   Israel and the U.S. have long called on the Palestinians to accept resolutions 242 and 338, which call for Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967, in return for the right of all states in the region to live peacefully with secure borders. 
But by tying their recognition of 242 to "all other U.N. resolutions" and to the acceptance of Palestinian self-determination, the Israeli government argues, the Palestinians made resolution 242 moot. 

   The government says other U.N. resolutions, by calling for sanctions and severing of all ties with Israel, equating Zionism with racism and stressing the right of Palestinians to return to their homes, seek to delegitimize Israel's right to exist. 
It also says that "self-determination" in Palestinian jargon has traditionally meant determining the right of the Palestinian people to all of Israel. 

   Palestinians are depressed by the Israeli reaction. 
"For years, Israelis have said they wanted to see {PLO Chairman} Yasser Arafat personally say these words" accepting Resolution 242, says Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of the Palestine Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs in Jerusalem. 
"We are offering now to free them from their nightmares of security -- we don't want to destroy Israel, we want to coexist. 
I know they don't want to see it, or read it, but it's there." 

   Some Israelis also are disappointed by the government's reaction. 
"The right wing, and to a lesser extent, the Foreign Ministry, are relieved that it isn't recognition," says Daniel Seidman, a lawyer and spokesman for Peace Now, the largest Israeli peace group. 
"Israel should toss down the gauntlet and say, 'Let's see exactly what you mean. 
We'll talk to the PLO if you quit hemming and hawing and say you'll accept a two-state solution achieved through political means.' 
The PLO just took half a step in the right direction. 
We need another step and a half, but instead of forcing them to take it, we're letting them off the hook," he says. 

   Even the Foreign Ministry's Mr. Liel acknowledges that the fact the PLO "even mentioned" resolutions 242 and 338, which it has previously refused to do, is "a positive element" that makes the Palestinians seem constructive and flexible, compared to recent Israeli rigidity. 

   And in contrast to the consensus the Palestinians were able to muster by winning the acquiescence of even their hardliners, the Israelis appear hopelessly divided as they try to cobble together a government after inconclusive elections. 

   "We realize it is putting us in a difficult position," Mr. Liel says. 
"The PLO has definitely gained some points."

<HL> Several Airlines Match Continental On Discount Fares </HL>

<IN> AIR </IN>
<TEXT>
   A number of major airlines adopted Continental Airlines' new discount fare structure, increasing the chance that higher fares for vacation travelers will appear in most markets. 

   The fare restructuring, aimed at tying prices to mileage flown, apparently will wipe away many of the bargain-basement fares currently available to leisure travelers, and make it likely that those travelers will pay $10 to $30 more on most fares. 
In some markets, Continental is raising fares by much more than that. 

   United Airlines, a UAL Corp. unit, Braniff and Delta Air Lines boosted discount fares yesterday in most of their markets, matching the new Continental structure for MaxSaver fares, its deepest discount tickets. 
Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, an NWA Inc. unit, had matched many of the fares before the end of the day Tuesday. 

   For the time being, at least, American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., Midway Airlines and Southwest Airlines are holding off from adopting the Continental fares. 

   Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., announced its new fare structure Monday, which will affect travel after next Tuesday. 
The Maxsaver fares are non-refundable, must be purchased 14 days in advance and require a Saturday night stayover. 

   The new fare structure represents one of the biggest overhauls of airline tariffs in recent years. 
Typically, when carriers introduce such a sweeping change they can get initial acceptance, but eventually fares in many markets have to be changed to meet their own particular competitive conditions. 

   For instance, under Continental's new fares the price of a one-way ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles would rise $90 based on the new mileage formula. 
But that's a highly competitive market and it's unlikely such a large increase will stick for long. 

   Thus, it's difficult to determine what the overall effect of the Continental pricing move will be. 
Most airlines believe that fares will rise by an average of between $10 and $20. 

   At the moment, most carriers are following the Continental price-mileage guidelines to the letter. 
For example, tickets for travel between 401 miles to 600 miles will cost $238 during peak hours when many people are traveling, and $198 off-peak. 
For longer distance travel, Continental has eight other mileage categories, each with a peak and off-peak price. 

   Over the next few days, airline pricing analysts will monitor the impact of the restructuring on major routes. 
As rivals put fare changes into their computerized systems, carriers will adjust their own fares on certain routes to stay competitive. 

   For example, Southwest Airlines typically doesn't follow industry fare changes and often brings the price of air travel down between cities in Texas, a major Southwest market. 

   As a result of similar situations in other competitive markets, pricing specialists expect airlines to deviate from their revised mileage structure with new promotions and discount fares. 

   "The industry periodically goes in and cleans up its fares," said one airline marketing official. 
"But discount fares spread just like crabgrass. 
If you have just a little patch it spreads all over the place."

   Robert Kuttner is economics correspondent of The New Republic, and columnist for Business Week. 

   Read my lips, indeed. 

   The bond market, our friendly creditors in Tokyo and Frankfurt, Alan Greenspan, James Baker, and the Congressional Budget Office, among others, have rendered a verdict on George Bush's "flexible freeze." 
It won't solve the problem. 

   As a good Keynesian, I join my supply-side comrades in not having an excessive phobia about deficits. 
With the proper timing, and the right dosage, deficits can be very tonic for the economy. 
But as Keynes himself taught, you can't go on using them year in and year out, especially when the borrowed money comes from overseas. 

   What the Bush ideology refuses to recognize, financial markets will dictate. 
With the dollar again sinking and the inflation rate creeping upward, the Germans, Japanese and Fed will refuse to resume playing Jim Baker's delicate game of currency management until there is serious progress on the deficit -- about $30 billion to $50 billion of deficit cuts next year. 

   If Mr. Bush fails to deliver, the result will be a necessary tightening of monetary policy to defend the dollar. 
That will lead to high interest rates and recession. 

   Obviously, it would be far better economics and politics to get a deficit reduction before the markets and the Fed hit the panic button. 
That way, a tighter fiscal policy would have a very well-timed rendezvous with lower interest rates, and the recovery would click into high gear. 

   How to get that deficit reduction? 
As it happens, the Democrats are in the catbird seat. 
They lost the White House after enduring all sorts of slanders from the Bush campaign, but they made gains in Congress. 
Mr. Bush does not take office with anything like Ronald Reagan's prestige, which so dazzled the Democrats of 1981. 

   The Democrats are likely to hold out for no serious cuts in domestic spending; substantial cuts in military outlays; a tax increase tilted toward those who got the greatest cuts in the 1980s (for example, a 38% top rate on the income tax; further closing of corporate loopholes; denying the interest deduction on debt-financed hostile takeovers; and the taxation of appreciated assets at death). 
A value-added tax, a prodigious revenue-raiser, is too good to waste on deficit reduction. 
If Mr. Bush fails to bargain, and the Federal Reserve acts accordingly, the resulting disaster will be blamed mainly on him. 

   The Democrats may well also insist that the fruits of new taxes include some additional spending, for widely acknowledged national needs like education. 
George Bush said he wanted to be remembered as the education president, didn't he? 
Let his education begin here.

<HL> Politics &amp; Policy: IRS 'Disinvites' a Speaker Who Refused To Delete Remarks on Campaign Gifts </HL>

   A lot of people agonize over the fear that the Internal Revenue Service is looking over their shoulders. 
Their anxiety puts them in good company: According to a tax-law professor at Emory University in Atlanta, the IRS has bugaboos of its own. 

   Prof. Richard L. Doernberg says he has been "disinvited" to be the keynote speaker at the IRS's sixth annual research conference this week, because he refused to delete remarks that might offend the congressmen who oversee the IRS. 

   The 40-year-old professor views the IRS's action as censorship. 
The IRS denies any fear of offending or any attempt to censor, although it confirms that it withdrew the invitation to the meeting after Prof. Doernberg declined to omit references to huge campaign contributions received by the powerful leaders in the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees -- references that would be "inappropriate for a government-sponsored conference." 

   The annual conferences represent a relatively recent effort by the IRS to open itself to the views of outside academic experts -- economists, lawyers, accountants, sociologists and psychologists -- on the factors that influence taxpayers' compliance with the law. 
Some participants present research papers for discussion by the other academics and IRS officials. 
This year's two-day meeting starts tomorrow at IRS headquarters in Washington. 

   Yet the dumping of Prof. Doernberg raises the question of whether the IRS really is ready to listen to the unrestrained views of outsiders. 

   "I find {the incident} quite distressing," says Michael J. Graetz, a Yale law professor, a former Treasury tax lawyer, and a regular IRS-conference participant. 
"It's crucial that free discussion of critical statements be permitted, and I had found the IRS to be quite open to discussing ideas." 

   Sociologist Kent Smith, an American Bar Foundation researcher, a former member of the IRS Commissioner's Advisory Group, and a regular conference participant, says the IRS's action is "disturbing, but understandable." 
On the one hand, he says, "it's improper behavior in terms of independent research and academic freedom." 
However, given the IRS's "closed-camp background," its "exceeding sensitivity" to congressional control of its budget, and its relative inexperience with independent research, "I can see why it happened," he says. 
"I guess I'm too much of a sociologist." 

   This year's conference topic is "Change and Complexity as Barriers to Taxpayer Compliance." 
Last June, the IRS invited Mr. Doernberg, Emory's K.H. Gyr professor of international legal studies, to be the keynote speaker on the basis, he says, of two 1987 law-review articles he had cowritten. 

   Distilled from the articles, the draft of his speech makes a connection between the complexity of the tax code and the heightened frequency of tax-law changes in recent years, a position no one would quarrel with. 
It also draws a connection between the increased frequency of legislation and the outpouring of lobbyists' contributions to the campaign funds of members of the tax-writing committees, a thesis that those parties would argue vehemently against. 

   Prof. Doernberg listed the heads of the committees as "the biggest beneficiaries" of those contributions, on the basis of reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. 
To be named were Democrat Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of Ways and Means; Democrat Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of Senate Finance and defeated vice presidential candidate, and two former Republican chairmen of Senate Finance, Bob Dole of Kansas and Bob Packwood of Oregon. 

   But after reading the draft, Prof. Doernberg says, IRS conference planners asked him to remove those names and stick to generalities. 
Even though the views were his own and not to be attributed to the IRS, he says, the IRS was concerned that such remarks in an IRS setting "might jeopardize the funding" for IRS research. 

   After reflecting, he continues, he told the IRS that he wouldn't remove information that was already in the public domain and added, "Of course, they had the option of disinviting me." 

   On Nov. 4, Roger L. Plate, director of the IRS research division, did just that. 

   Ellen Murphy, assistant for public affairs to IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs, says the request to alter the speech had nothing to do with a fear of offending four powerful men. 
Rather, she says, the speech came to a lot of "unsupported" conclusions from old information that was inappropriate for a conference looking for new approaches to coping with complexity. 

   Messrs. 
Rostenkowski, Bentsen, Dole, and Packwood couldn't be reached for comment. 

   But "ultimately," says Yale Prof. Graetz, "the IRS does itself more harm by disinviting someone than by hearing what he has to say."

<HL> ITT Sues RJR, Saying Buy-Out Devalues Bonds </HL>

   ITT Corp. threw another punch in the growing rebellion of bondholders against giant debt-financed takeovers, filing suit here against RJR Nabisco Inc. 

   In the federal-court suit, ITT's Hartford insurance units charge that their portfolios were hurt because RJR didn't disclose that it was considering a leveraged buy-out when it sold them bonds in April. 

   ITT, an ardent critic of management-led buy-outs, also vowed yesterday not to make any new investments in leveraged buy-out funds. 

   Last April, two of ITT's Hartford insurance units bought $25 million out of a $300 million public bond offering by RJR, the big food and tobacco company. 
ITT's suit says the prospectus "failed to disclose that RJR's senior management . . . was considering fundamental and major changes" that would jeopardize the bonds' rating "and decrease their price." 

   After RJR announced Oct. 20 that a management group was considering a $17.6 billion buy-out, prices of RJR bonds, and corporate debt issues generally, fell sharply. 
The old debt suddenly seemed riskier in view of the mountain of additional debt needed for buy-outs. 

   Hartford's paper losses on its RJR bonds currently are estimated at about $1.4 million, compared with the insurer's total bond portfolio of some $15 billion. 
But beyond the attempt to recover its RJR bond investment is a broader attempt by ITT and its chairman, Rand V. Araskog, to create a corporate rebellion against management-led buy-outs, most of which Mr. Araskog thinks are "unethical." 

   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Araskog said he has asked trustees of the ITT and Hartford pension funds not to make further investments in leveraged buy-out funds. 
ITT will decide whether to renew its current investments with LBO sponsors when proceeds from those funds are distributed over the next several years. 

   An RJR spokesman said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation. 

   Mr. Araskog had said earlier that ITT, which has $30 million invested in an LBO fund of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., would try to withdraw from the fund if KKR proceeded with a hostile attempt to take over RJR. ITT's lawyers later determined that the company couldn't withdraw. 
But by then RJR's board said it was putting the company up for bids, making all offers friendly. 

   As a result, Mr. Araskog said yesterday, he's now "certainly not opposed to (KKR) bidding or using our money" as part of an offer. 

   An RJR board committee has set Friday as the deadline for bids, which are expected from KKR and a separate management-led group working with the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
A third group, led by the leveraged buy-out firm of Forstmann Little, said yesterday it wouldn't submit a bid. 

   ITT's suit reflects the growing ferment among bondholders, who have been demanding far greater price protection from debt issuers. 
New "super poison puts" are being added to offerings, broadening the conditions under which buyers are shielded if there is a change in control of the issuer. 

   Mr. Araskog said the poison put provisions inserted into bond covenants in the past failed to protect Hartford and other bondholders against price collapses caused by buy-out proposals. 
These earlier poison puts were intended to allow bondholders to get their money back if a buy-out was hostile, but the defense proved impotent as nearly all buy-outs eventually became "friendly." 

   A few management buy-outs do serve shareholders, notably in cases where an outsider's initial bid is topped by management, Mr. Araskog said. 
He said that he has always opposed hostile bids and that when the ITT pension fund invested in the KKR buy-out pool, it understood that KKR's bids would be friendly. 
"Of course, it's friendly now that the board is auctioning off the company, but that's probably not what others had in mind when they put the company together," Mr. Araskog said. 

   The ITT chairman said he "applauded" calls in Congress for reviews of the tax deductability of debt interest payments while corporate dividends are not higher because they are paid from after-tax profits. 
"This whole area should be looked at," Mr. Araskog said. 
But he added: "The last thing we want is an overreaction in Washington" that might go beyond his concerns on leveraged buy-outs. 

   Some people see irony in ITT's stand, given the company's transformation into one of the original conglomerates through numerous acquisitions led by former Chairman Harold Geneen. 
Some also say that ITT itself may be concerned about its future as a potential takeover target. 

   Mr. Araskog says ITT never made an unfriendly acquisition and company officials say they don't know of any takeover possibilities involving ITT.

<HL> PEOPLE PATTERNS -- Population Projections ---- Compiled by the staff of American Demographics magazine </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
      Census Bureau Sees
   Slow U.S. Growth Ahead
   ACCORDING TO projections published today by the Census Bureau, there will be nearly 250 million people in the U.S. by 1990, up 23.3 million from 1980. 
If the 1990 census proves these figures correct, the U.S. population will have grown by only 10.3% this decade, the lowest rate in U.S. history except for the Depression years of the 1930s, when it was 7.2%. 
The projections also indicate record low growth in the near future: 7.2% in the 1990s and 5.3% between 2000 and 2010. 

   But the bureau foresees wide variation from state to state. 
For example, it expects that during the 1980s, four states (Iowa, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio) will together have lost nearly 300,000 people. 
At the other extreme, the four fastest-growing states (Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Alaska) are expected each to have grown more than 30%, adding a total of 4.6 million people. 

   Fastest growth doesn't mean most growth, however. 
About half of total U.S. growth for the rest of the century will occur in just three states -- Texas, Florida and California -- which are expected to gain 12 million people in the 1980s and 9.5 million in the 1990s.

   Interstate Migration
   Plays a Key Role
   THE CENSUS Bureau's projections assume that past trends in birth, death and migration rates will continue. Natural increase (births minus deaths) varies little from state to state, so interstate migration is often the key in determining future populations. For example, Michigan is projected to gain 435,000 people from natural increase during the 1990s -- but lose 498,000 to out-migration.
   While all 50 states are expected to show positive natural increase this decade, 24 will see that growth partially or completely offset by people leaving. Positive natural increase is seen for most states during the next decade as well, but Florida could be an unusual case. It is projected to have 20,000 more deaths than births between 1990 and 2000. A net in-migration of 2.6 million, though, will overwhelm this negative natural increase.
   Many factors can influence migration, perhaps even government intervention. New York state, which lost population in the 1970s, has lowered personal income tax rates and some business taxes. Coincidentally or not, it is expected to gain 215,000 people this decade.
   Workers Seen Carrying
   Fewer Dependents
   PROMISING A lighter burden of support, the overall dependency ratio in the U.S. is expected to decline to 57 by 2010 from 62 in 1987. The ratio measures the number of dependents (children under 18 and people 65 and older) for every 100 nondependents (those 18 to 64).
   The number of nondependents will rise 17% between 1990 and 2010, while that of dependents will grow only 7%, according to the Census Bureau's forecast. However, these figures mask differences between the young and the elderly, as well as among geographic regions.
   The number of people 65 and older is projected to grow 25% between 1990 and 2010, raising the elderly dependency ratio to 21.9 from 20.5. The ratio for those under 18 will drop to 34.8 from 41.5, as fewer children are born.
   The dependency ratio is based strictly on age groups and makes no assumptions about true dependence. In fact, more than 10% of the elderly were employed in 1987, and only 72% of working-age people were actually working.
   Study Profiles Network
   Of Family Support
   MORE THAN FOUR million Americans provide financial support to seven million young children living outside their households, according to another new Census Bureau report; two million provide support to three million adults outside their homes, mostly elderly parents. Of these providers, 6% are helping both children and adults who don't live with them. The bureau estimates that payments total $19 billion a year.
   The typical provider is a divorced father 25 to 44 years old. On average, providers have an annual family income of $37,800 and pay $3,000 a year in support; those supporting both kids and adults average $43,500 in income and $8,400 in support annually. The largest amount of support -- an average of $7,800 -- goes to spouses who are separated or temporarily living apart. Ex-spouses get the next-largest chunk, averaging $4,700 each. Children 21 and older receive an average of $3,800 a year; those under 21 get $1,600 on average. Parents receiving support get an average of $1,500.

   Edmund T. Pratt Jr. is CEO of Pfizer Inc. and chairman of the Business Roundtable. 

   The Roundtable submitted to the National Economic Commission several principles that will be fundamental to the deficit solution. 

   First, we believe the federal budget deficit and associated debt are the most critical economic problem facing the nation. 
It must be addressed promptly, while continuing economic expansion still permits timely action. 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets must be supported so that the deficit can be reduced to zero by 1993. 
Also, the Social Security surplus should not "fund" the deficit. 

   Second, we believe that spending restraints must be the top priority. 
Our efforts to control spending should emphasize structural changes with significant long-term effects, such as appropriate changes in eligibility criteria for entitlement programs. 
We also believe that if new legislative initiatives are to be pursued, the means of their funding should be identified at the same time. 

   Third, we recommend a move to a two-year budget cycle that would allow Congress time to reassess existing programs and set new priorities. 
In addition, we should experiment with enhancing the president's rescission authority as a means of firming up the budget process. 

   Our fourth principle reflects a belief that the government can continue to meet the legitimate needs of our citizens and still modify the growth of entitlement programs. 
About 85% of all entitlement spending is not "means tested." 
In other words, the benefit is provided regardless of need. 
Conversely, reductions in means-tested aid programs for the poor are not an appropriate way to reduce the budget deficit. 

   Our fifth and sixth principles link America's economic growth and international economic competitiveness to the success of deficit-control efforts. 
We believe that further increases in business taxes would be counterproductive in terms of economic growth and competitiveness. 

   Furthermore, if economic growth and U.S. competitiveness are essential to winning the deficit war, then so is a more stable tax system. 
The 1987 tax act was the 11th significant tax bill since 1980. 
Business cannot plan effectively with important tax changes being made at that rate. 
In addition, the code is unnecessarily complex. 
Most corporations must employ several different depreciation systems to comply with government requirements. 
And U.S. rules for taxing foreign income are the most complicated of any major nation in the world. 

   The Roundtable's seventh and final principle focuses on the need to link greater U.S. fiscal discipline to increased efforts, both on our part and those of our trading partners, to promote growth in the world economy and in international trade. 
Japan, West Germany and other major trading partners, for example, should be encouraged to promote expansion of their own economies in order to sustain global economic growth. 
Europe and Japan should remove tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, as well as import greater amounts from the developing world. 
We also urge greater cooperation and coordination of economic and monetary policy among the Group of Seven to resolve the Third World debt crisis.

<HL> Does 'Iliad' Lose A Little in Recital By an Accountant? --- Mr. Powelson Can Reel It Off In Greek, From Memory, But His Audiences Yawn </HL>
<AUTHOR> Lee Berton (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
      The wrath do thou sing, O goddess, of
   Peleus' son, Achilles . . . 

   So begins Homer's 15,693-line "Iliad." 
It would take all day, from rosy-fingered dawn to dark-browed night, to recite the entire epic of the siege of Troy -- just the thing, perhaps, to stave off boredom on a New York-Beijing flight or a Saturday night in the drunk tank. 

   If your muse isn't up to it, no matter. 
The bard of Les-Loges-en-Josas, France, Stephen Powelson, stands ready, able and more than merely willing to pour the first 14,300 lines into your ear, from memory -- and in classical Greek. 
Soon, he hopes, he will have committed the final 1,393 lines to memory. 

   Mr. Powelson, a 70-year-old accountant, lives in the Paris suburb of Les-Loges-en-Josas, near Versailles. 
He has returned to the U.S. at least 40 times in the past 10 years to do the "Iliad" thing, usually for not more than an hour or two, at schools and colleges. 
At these exhibitions of mnemonic prowess, a resident classicist randomly picks a line from the epic, and Mr. Powelson takes it from there. 

   Awesome. 
Says Mr. Powelson: "Everyone I meet can hardly wait to see if I can meet all these challenges." 

   But don't roll over, Homer, not just yet. 
As you might have put it, not all men reckon as sweeter than honey the words that escape the barrier of the many-languaged Mr. Powelson's teeth. 
To put it more bluntly, some people, including several classicists, say Mr. Powelson comes off as a crashing bore, ruining the poetry of the "Iliad" by reciting it in a relentless, mind-numbing, mile-a-minute monotone. 

   Gordon Kirkwood, a retired classics professor at Cornell University, describes a Powelson performance as "an amazing tour de force." 
But, he says, "It's something to admire from a distance rather than hear." 
Mr. Kirkwood, an authority on Greek life some 3,000 years ago, says that "the original rhapsodists who recited the 'Iliad' did it with a lot of emotion. 
Some might even weep or cry, and it was a very lively experience as contrasted with what Mr. Powelson does." 

   Alice Bennink, whose husband was a 1938 classmate of Mr. Powelson's at Harvard College, heard Mr. Powelson's recitation at a class reunion last June. 
"He's learned it by rote, so he rattles on very quickly and almost without any verbal or facial expression," Mrs. Bennink says. 
"I can't believe that the original bards of Greece narrated it like that." 

   Yet Mr. Powelson manages to keep the invitations coming. 
Z. Philip Ambrose, chairman of the classics department at the University of Vermont, says that "Steve Powelson is very singleminded, and he's a great promoter of himself." 
Mr. Powelson recited about an hour's worth of the "Iliad" from memory at the university in early 1987 before an audience of about 100. 

   "I'd heard about Powelson from another classicist at the University of Maryland, and then Powelson began to besiege me with letters asking for an invitation," Mr. Ambrose says. 
"Before he did the recitation, I thought I was going to be knocked out. 
But frankly, I found myself nodding at one of the greatest works of literature." 

   At dinner, Mr. Ambrose says, Mr. Powelson couldn't stop reciting the "Iliad." 
"It's an obsession with him," he says. 
"No matter what topic we brought up -- when I told him someone I know had broken a leg -- he would somehow relate it to the 'Iliad' and then begin his recitation all over again. 
I could hardly wait to get away." 

   Mr. Powelson says he isn't an "Iliad"-obsessed bore. 
"I participate in chess tournaments, play tennis and squash, and my favorite sport is water skiing," he says. 
"Why, I can even ski on one foot backwards." 
He does admit to running through the tale of the siege of Troy in fast-forward mode, "because that's the way I have to learn it. 
It's so long and filled with almost unending lists of proper names in some sections." 

   The "Iliad" has 24 books, totaling 600 pages. 
One section in Book II lists the names of 498 Greek ships and warriors in close order. 
Book XVIII contains 33 complex names of sea nymphs. 
When Mr. Powelson recites these names rapid-fire, he sounds like the late Danny Kaye reeling off the tongue-twisting names of 49 Russian composers in only 39 seconds in his novelty song "Tchaikovsky" in the 1941 Weill-Gershwin musical, "Lady in the Dark." 

   Various devices help Mr. Powelson retrieve long strings of names from his memory. 
"Three of the sea nymphs, for example, each has a name that involves water," he says. 
The syllable "cym" in Cymothoe means wave in classical Greek. 
"Actae" in Actaea means beach, and "limne" in Limnoreia means lake. 
Thinking of "a man with a fork of chrome who's an enemy" cues his recall of other names, Phorcys, Chromius and Enmemus. 

   Mr. Powelson began his bardship in 1977, when he was 60. 
Unemployed, with no job in sight, he decided to renew his interest in the classics and memorize the "Iliad" "as a mind exercise to keep me busy and from worrying about getting a job. 
For that sort of thing, my memory is good," he says. 

   At the age of 10, he says, he memorized in one week an entire year's homework in Sunday-school Bible studies. 
In prep school, he memorized the first 100 lines of the "Iliad," took three Greek courses in his senior year and won a national prize for his Greek. 
At Harvard, he studied Greek drama for only one semester and then had "nothing to do with Greek," he says, for 39 years. 

   Mr. Powelson eventually got the job he still holds, managing an office for an Arab businessman in Paris. 
Not long after, friends suggested that he go public with his feat of memory. 
"It sounded like a good idea," Mr. Powelson recalls. 
So he began soliciting appearances at colleges, prep schools and literary clubs in the U.S. and Europe. 
He has performed at the Universities of Arkansas, Colorado and Massachusetts and at Tulane University, among other places. 

   His wife of 47 years, Esther, says that Mr. Powelson is constantly mastering new lines. 
"When we go to lunch and we're waiting for the check or on a station platform waiting for a train, he pulls out his copy of the 'Iliad,'" she says. 
"Sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and leaves the bedroom to look up a word in classical Greek." 

   But, she says, "while my husband's memory is phenomenal, it is very selective. 
I still have to find his glasses and keys for him. 
He just doesn't remember where he puts them."

   Administration officials, trying to minimize the budgetary impact of rescuing insolvent banks and thrifts, are considering removing their insurance funds from the federal budget. 

   The idea is one of several being circulated at the Treasury Department, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Home Loan Bank Board, officials said. 
But they indicated such options haven't proceeded much past the brainstorming stage. 
Said one, "It's early in the game." 

   Supporters of the off-budget move said it would help the new administration to avoid inflating the budget deficit with more than $50 billion in spending over several years to rescue or close insolvent thrifts. 
But some other officials worried that Congress would loudly reject the move as budgetary sleight-of-hand. 

   Officials also are talking of new, creative financing schemes that could raise large sums of cash for the funds without big hits to the budget. 
These involve making annual commitments of Treasury funds or pledging insurance fees from the FDIC or the bank board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to pay interest on major new bond offerings in the credit markets. 
But to keep most of the financing off the budget, officials need to find a credible, non-governmental source of cash to repay the principal. 
And so far, officials said, that hasn't been identified. 

   One option under discussion is to issue bonds guaranteed by a line of credit at the Treasury, with the Treasury paying all or part of the interest. 
"It's one of the areas that we're looking at," said FDIC Chairman William Seidman. 

   Such a solution was implemented to rescue the Farm Credit System over the past year, with the interest payments split between the Treasury and the Farm Credit System. 
Eric Thor, president and chief executive officer of the Farm Credit System Assistance Board, said, "That's one of the options being considered by my boss at Treasury, Secretary (Nicholas) Brady." 

   To minimize the budget impact, the Farm Credit System is pledged to repay both principal and Treasury interest payments in full. 
But that approach may not work in the deeply troubled thrift industry, which appears to lack the resources to repay in the foreseeable future the principal and interest on securities used to finance its own bailout. 

   "The question is when it would be repaid," said one administration official. 
"I don't want to hold my breath." 

   Key congressional staffers were even more skeptical. 
"Everybody knows the (thrift) industry can't pay for it," said one. 

   That may tempt officials to look to the banks' insurance fund to provide the added financial backing. 
In fact, some bankers have floated a plan under which some FDIC premiums would be converted to help carry the cost of a bond-offering to rescue thrifts. 

   But that option faces many obstacles. 
The FDIC fund is generally viewed as too shaky to help much. 
Banking experts at Congress' General Accounting Office are expected to report soon that a merger of the insurance funds wouldn't contribute to solving the thrift problem. 
Most banks oppose using their fees to support their thrift competitors. 
And with political opposition to an insurance fund consolidation mounting, one administration official said talk about combining insurance funds is receding. 

   The option of taking the insurance funds off the budget was cited by two top officials yesterday, and is said to have the support of the FDIC's Mr. Seidman. 

   The finances of the insurance agencies weren't included in the federal budget until the mid-1960s, administration officials noted. 
President Johnson arranged to put them in the budget because their surpluses helped compensate for the budgetary drain of the Vietnam War, officials said. 

   But officials emphasized that such considerations remain preliminary. 
A team of Treasury Department officials, running thrift data and economic variables through sophisticated models, still hasn't agreed on the likely cost of the thrift problem, said one official. 
"This is kind of study time," he said.

   HOME FURNISHINGS become a bright spot on the retailers' horizon. 

   The market for home gear is growing as spending shifts from apparel to the home, says Kurt Barnard of the Retail Marketing Report, New York. 
He says sales at home-related stores are growing 91% faster than at department stores and 75% faster than at apparel stores. 
The trend is making the market "less dependent on housing-market cycles," says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist of Management Horizons, Dublin, Ohio. 
While second-quarter housing starts were down 30% from two years ago, furniture sales were up 18%, he says. 

   Retailers position themselves to cash in on the demographics of aging baby-boomers and growing home ownership, says Les Gilbert of HFD, a trade publication. 
Some department stores, such as Macy's, open free-standing home-furnishings stores. 
Others simply expand their offerings of tabletop goods, linens and other home furnishings. 

   But home furnishing remains "a more difficult business" than apparel, which is easier to display and handle, says Joseph Ellis of Goldman Sachs. 

   EMPTY HOSPITAL BEDS create opportunities in the movie business. 

   Faced with vacant wings or even buildings, a growing number of hospitals are marketing themselves as film locations. 
"It can be fairly lucrative," says Katherine Smith of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in California. 
Used in the TV miniseries "Liberace," the hospital charges $3,500 a day plus fees for personnel. 
Los Angeles-area hospitals are the most active, but Steve Taravella of Modern Healthcare magazine cites hospitals in New York, Maryland and Canada that have also benefited. 

   The most aggressive: California Medical Center, Los Angeles, which expects to net $200,000 from filming this year. 
In addition to making vacant hospital space available, it rents medical equipment, provides technical advisers and even supplies prop food. 
"Basically my goal has been to make us into a production facility," says Vicki Spencer, the hospital's filming coordinator. 
Even bankrupt Lake View Medical Center, Lake View Terrace, Calif., now closed and shuttered, finds a calling as a film location, making $637,000 in the past two years. 

   KIDS ON THE SLOPES become big business for the ski industry. 

   With 40% of all skiers now parents, more resorts market their facilities to the junior set. 
Copper Mountain in Colorado adds a ski playground. 
Nearby Breckenridge Ski Corp. more than doubles its children's-center space. 
In northern Vermont, Smugglers' Notch offers a money-back guarantee that children will have fun. 
Sierra Ski Ranch near Lake Tahoe, Calif., says it gets up to 20 phone calls a day from parents asking about kids' facilities. 

   Ski stores also target kids. 
Ski Market Ltd., Waltham, Mass., guarantees parents will get 50% of the purchase price back when they turn their kids' old boots in for new ones. 
"If we can get kids involved today, hopefully, they'll be our customers when they're adults," explains Christopher Leake. 
Demand keeps growing. 
Bob's Ski Shop in Portland, Ore., says it can't keep enough kids' skis in stock. 

   Manufacturers take smaller margins on kids' equipment, which sells for half the price of adult gear, says Ken Gart of Gart Bros., a Colorado-Utah chain. 

   RABBIS AND MINISTERS can now get discounts of up to 50% by using ClergyCard, developed by the Rev. William McPhail of Muskegon, Mich. 
The card, available for $40 to clergy and religious staff, is good on everything from brake jobs at K mart to tickets to the Dollywood amusement park. 

   BAR NUNN, WYO., and 51 other small towns in the U.S. and Canada are getting "put on the map" by Rand McNally &amp; Co. this week with its 1989 road atlas. 
Connecticut sees the most additions, with 19 of its towns being added to the map. 

   CORONARY QUESTIONS will be answered free of charge by Cleveland Clinic Foundation experts in a one-day phone program Dec. 1. 
People calling 1-800-525-7455 can quiz cardiovascular and cerebrovascular specialists on stroke and heart disease. 

   TECHNICAL DEFAULTS and confusion may accompany a new accounting rule. 

   Many companies will find billions of dollars more debt on their year-end balance sheets, thanks to a new accounting rule that will force them to consolidate the results of all majority-held subsidiaries. 
"It will create some technical defaults," says John Robbins of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., New York, noting that increased debt ratios may violate some loan covenants. 
For most, that will mean minor loan-agreement changes, but Mr. Robbins says lenders could use the defaults to restructure loans or raise fees. 

   But the biggest headache may be the confusion created by the consolidated statements. 
"The balance sheets are going to look very different," says Pat McConnell, managing director at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., New York. 
"It will make them more difficult to understand." 
General Motors Corp. says that change will add 12 pages to its annual report. 

   All internal financial data will remain unconsolidated, says Eugene Flegm, GM assistant controller, requiring the firm to keep two sets of books. 

   BRIEFS: After 15 years, three months and four days, "The New York Experience" will end its run Jan. 2. 
The multiscreen film lost its lease. . . . 
Hourlong videos from Relax Video, New York, offer stationary-bicycle riders bike-ride scenery from Florida, New England or the beach.

<HL> Los Angeles County Plans to Sell Bonds Linked to the Yen </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles County announced plans to issue bonds denominated in a foreign currency. 
It would be the first municipality to issue such securities. 

   The novel financing will enable the county to bypass Wall Street securities firms, U.S. investors and congressional curbs on tax-exempt debt. 

   The county said that before the end of the year it will issue $100 million in 10-year yen-denominated bonds. 
The debt will be privately placed with Nippon Life Insurance Co. and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. 
Unlike the majority of bonds issued by municipalities, the bonds will be taxable, not tax-exempt. 

   "Essentially, we are borrowing the equivalent of $100 million in yen and re-investing it in high-yield securities," said Richard B. Dixon, chief administrative officer of the county. 
At least half the investment portfolio will consist of dollar-denominated foreign securities, he said. 
For diversification purposes, the portfolio won't include Japanese debt. 

   As a result of a series of foreign-currency swaps that will lock in interest rates for the life of the issue, the county won't incur currency risks, Mr. Dixon said. 

   Profit from the transaction will be used to fund future liabilities of a county employee pension plan. 
The county had to issue taxable bonds because the sale of tax-exempts for that purpose is prohibited by the 1986 tax law. 

   While First Boston Corp. is serving as financial adviser, the county is serving as its own underwriter on the offering -- a job that would have earned a Wall Street securities firm at least $1 million. 

   The bond sale, which will take place by the year end, will cost the county the rate on the 10-year Treasury bond, plus 58 basis points, or 9.59%, based on the Treasury bond's current yield. (A basis point is 1/100th of one percentage point.) 
When translated into yen, the Japanese investors will be earning the equivalent of that country's prime rate of 5.75%. 

   Mr. Dixon, in a telephone interview from Tokyo, said the county would most likely have had to pay at least three-quarters of one percentage point above the 10-year Treasury bond rate if it had attempted to sell the debt in the U.S. 

   He predicted the sale would be the first of several by his county to Japanese investors, and could start an industry trend. 

   Two earlier foreign-currency denominated issues, offered to the public in June 1987 by Iowa and by Los Angeles County, were canceled because they didn't comply with Treasury regulations on the sale of debt to domestic investors. 
But this overseas bond sale isn't covered by those regulations, said Mr. Dixon. 

   Foreign-currency denominated debt "has great potential" for state and local governments, said Michael Gomez, a public finance official in the San Francisco office of First Boston. 
"Other highly rated municipalities will find it beneficial to explore foreign countries for their borrowing, especially if . . . it becomes more difficult to issue tax-exempts" in the U.S. 

   Mr. Gomez said, however, that First Boston hasn't finalized plans with other municipalities for similar financings. 

   The bond issue is "terrific" because it opens international markets to state and local governments, said Steve Hueglin, an executive vice president of the New York bond firm Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman. 
But, he added, foreign-denominated financings will most likely be limited to municipalities that are issuing a large amount of debt, and that have "a profile abroad to give them market recognition."

   James Dale Davidson is chairman of the National Taxpayers Union. 

   George Bush faces a more interesting fiscal challenge than any president since George Washington took office with the national debt in default and U.S. government securities selling for 15 cents on the dollar. 
Our current fix is hardly that acute. 
But things could slip out of control unless decisive action is taken. 
The 1982 slump multiplied federal red ink two and a half times over. 
The next recession could send the deficit toward the half-trillion-dollar level, pushing interest rates skyward and deep-sixing the economy. 

   To avoid that, Mr. Bush must act immediately to reform federal spending. 
This is not the hopeless task that many believe. 
He holds a card that his antagonists in the Congress cannot counter. 
As president, Mr. Bush can lead a popular drive for a constitutional convention to draft a balanced-budget amendment. 
Polls show that overwhelming majorities of both parties support this reform. 
All that stalls it is lack of visible leadership at the national level. 
As president, Mr. Bush could dispel the whispers about conspiracies to gut the Constitution that have confused the balanced-budget drive at the state level. 
The only group in America with something to fear from an Article V convention are the members of Congress whose powers it would curtail. 
Mr. Bush should capitalize on this fact to push Congress into proposing its own balanced-budget amendment, including provisions limiting taxes and granting the line-item veto. 

   Mr. Bush holds another strong card that Mr. Reagan chose not to play. 
The U.S. now spends $150 billion a year defending our allies. 
Relative to gross national product, we spend 50% more than NATO and 500% more than Japan. 
This extra burden hinders our industrial competitiveness and is a major cause of our budget woes. 
Accordingly, Mr. Bush should seek early agreement with Mr. Gorbachev for conventional-force reductions. 
Pending success of these talks, the president should make continued military subsidies dependent on concessionary financing by the allies. 
The wealthy countries whose defense we shoulder, especially Japan, should purchase non-negotiable U.S. government securities bearing interest at 5% or less. 

   Mr. Bush should go beyond his campaign pledge of a flexible freeze to realize substantial savings in domestic spending. 
Farm and business subsidies should be phased out over four years. 
The Medicare deductible should be raised to $200 to better reflect inflation since the program began in 1966. 
Civil service and military-retirement ages should be raised, and the windfall portion of Social Security benefits should be counted as ordinary income for tax purposes. 

   Mr. Bush should also raise spending where it is needed by taking prompt action to close the bankrupt S&amp;Ls. 
Federal deposit insurance should be restructured along British lines, limiting coverage for any individual to a fraction of his total deposits. 

   Privatization should be used on a sweeping basis to speed crucial infrastructure repairs, including rebuilding bridges, replacing unsafe dams and expanding water-treatment facilities to meet EPA standards. 
And yes, privatization also should be employed to build prisons so that we can keep dangerous criminals off the streets. 

   A combination of constitutional budget reform, conventional-force reductions and modest domestic spending cuts would enable Mr. Bush to fulfill his campaign promises, including his pledge to control the deficit without raising taxes. 
He should. 
The problem is not a lack of revenue, but an inability of Congress to control spending. 
Adjusted for inflation, tax receipts have risen by over 22% since 1980.

<HL> Marketing &amp; Media: Sacre Rouge! California Vintners Uncork a New Beaujolais Nouveau </HL>
<AUTHOR> Peter Waldman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<CO> EUROP </CO>
<IN> MKT BVG </IN>
<TEXT>
   In the rarified world of wine, there is one time of year when even the snootiest sommelier likes a wine he can gulp. 

   Today, the third Thursday of November, French law decrees that vintners in France's Beaujolais district may unveil their Beaujolais nouveau, the fruity red that many wine lovers anticipate with the enthusiasm usually reserved for more savory, vintage varieties. 
Savvy French marketers have nurtured the annual event by heralding the wine's release with a race to world markets via such conveyances as the Concorde, parachutes and hot-air balloons. 

   Now some California wineries want in on the act. 
This fall, at least four West Coast vintners, led by Napa Valley's Charles Shaw Winery, bottled a total of more than 20,000 cases of locally grown "Beaujolais nouveau." 
Even New Jersey's Tewksbury Wine Cellars, although just a small player, is aggressively marketing its own Jersey nouveau this year. 

   The wine has taken time to catch on among U.S. wine makers because it's less profitable to produce than other varieties. 
And although U.S. vintners still make just a drop in the barrel compared with France's 1987 production of 6.8 million cases of Beaujolais nouveau, wine experts expect the domestic product to grow in popularity and volume in coming years. 

   "This is certainly as good as the stuff they're sending from France," says Anthony Dias Blue, wine editor of Bon Appetit magazine and a syndicated columnist. 

   But taste, as Mr. Blue points out, isn't really the issue. 
Most wines are sold on image, and even brands of well known wines like Beaujolais nouveau must cultivate the right cachet to attract a following. 
This means that to penetrate the Beaujolais nouveau market, even in California, West Coast vintners must persuade consumers that the local wines pack as much prestige as the famed nouveaus of France. 
And that won't be easy, say some wine merchants. 

   "The excitement just isn't there for California nouveau," says Jacob Malec, proprietor of Val de Cole Wines &amp; Spirits in San Francisco. 
"They haven't built up that great anticipation for the release date like they have in France. 
Nobody ever comes in and asks, 'hey, Jacob, when is the California Beaujolais coming'." 

   Indeed, Charles Shaw's Gamay Beaujolais nouveau, by far the largest-selling U.S.-made nouveau with 15,000 cases shipped this year, doesn't even have a particular release date. 
Kobrand Corp., the New York-based wine marketer that is handling the Shaw product, has devised a strategy to play down the wine's release, but emphasize its early availability for Thanksgiving. 

   "We're not sitting here waiting for the clock," Charles Shaw says. 
"We designed a wine and gave it a function: This is a harvest wine for family celebrations like Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
We imagine the Norman Rockwell couple with their turkey and our wine." 

   The Charles Shaw nouveau, as with a similar wine made by Sonoma Valley's Sebastiani Vineyards, is made from Gamay Beaujolais grapes, the same berries used in most types of French Beaujolais nouveau. 
It is processed using a technique called carbonic maceration, or what the French call la methode Beaujolaise. 

   This entails fermenting the grapes whole, rather than crushed, in a tank of carbon dioxide, instead of air. 

   Charles Shaw's wine, priced at around $5.50 a bottle and labeled with a "harvest" scene of orange, red and brown maple leaves, is targeted at consumers who generally know little about the traditions of French Beaujolais nouveau. 
The Kobrand people say Americans have trouble choosing wines to suit the varied flavors and spices of Thanksgiving foods, creating an opportunity for a Shaw nouveau with mass appeal. 

   "This is a fun wine, a simple wine made to be drunk young," says Gerard Yernault, Kobrand's executive vice president. 
"It's not cerebral or anything you have to think about." 

   Some wine sellers think the Kobrand campaign is a bit too simpleminded. 
Mr. Malec, for one, echoing a truism in the high-end wine business, says the California nouveau wines won't win popular appeal until they've converted the cognoscenti. 
And that's not likely to happen soon, says Andrew Spiegel, a wine merchant with Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco. 

   "A lot of Americans just want a real easy beverage to drink and that's what the Shaw nouveau is," he says. 
"But it's not a wine for a serious drinker. 
It just doesn't have the quality of a good Beaujolais nouveau from France."

   Newt Gingrich is a Republican congressman from Georgia. 

   The Bush administration must focus its first year on winning control of federal spending for the entire first term. 
President Bush should propose a four-year budget, with four years of spending controls. 
He should offer to run the Pentagon on a zero-growth budget for four years, as long as Congress will give up micromanagement and mandated waste. 
He should propose dramatic reforms to transform the liberal welfare state into an empowerment-oriented opportunity society. 

   Tenant management of public housing, work force, choice in medicare, parental influence over and involvement in schools, and tough anti-drug, anti-crime and anti-teen gang policies are among the reforms that can provide better services within a flexible freeze. 

   By siding with the poor and taking power away from unionized bureaucracies, the Bush administration can rally new support for its policies. 
By proposing a four-year budget that controls spending and rejects tax increases, the Bush administration can rally conservatives, professionals and working taxpayers. 
The combination of bold reforms, spending controls and practical solutions to real problems will create a governing conservative framework that most Americans will support. 
When enough Americans contact their senators and congressmen, the one key vote next spring can give Mr. Bush the spending authority to avoid any tax increases.

   Brace yourself. 
The glutted oil market could soon be flooded with even more Persian Gulf crude. 

   Saudi Arabia, faced with widening deficits as oil prices slip, has reached a Draconian decision: Unless OPEC regains control of world petroleum markets at meetings beginning here today, the Saudis will produce all the oil they can sell. 

   "There is no cap," declares a Saudi official familiar with the kingdom's strategy. 
"We need the revenue." 

   This could mean Saudi output of as much as 10 million barrels a day, more than 40% above what the kingdom pumps now and more than twice its OPEC quota. 
The delicate oil markets couldn't begin to withstand such a surfeit. 
Leading spokesmen for the cartel, including its secretary-general, former Indonesian oil minister Subroto, have warned that oil prices could crash to $5 a barrel if the Saudis pumped oil flat out. 

   The repercussions would be widespread. 
The whole scenario is speculative, of course, but one could suppose that a single-digit oil price would, on the positive side, strongly restrain world inflation and reduce costs for countless energy users. 
However, demand would presumably rise, and energy conservation efforts would fall off. 
And because $5 is less than it costs to pump a barrel in many oil fields, especially outside the Mideast, exploration would all but cease and large amounts of production would close down. 
Indebted oil-producing nations like Mexico and Nigeria would be even more strapped, while the Southwestern U.S. -- its suffering banks and S&amp;Ls, its real estate, its local governments -- would take another merciless hammering. 

   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may avert such a course. 
Oddsmakers in world oil markets give the crumbling cartel a 50-50 chance of resolving the deepening crisis of overproduction, which has depressed crude-oil prices by a third this year. 
Should the Vienna meetings achieve a new quota agreement and a commitment by members to honor it, oil prices -- now around $12 a barrel -- would certainly stop sliding, and they could increase by $2 or more. 

   Given the weakened state of OPEC, the Vienna get-together is regarded as a make-or-break meeting. 
Its outcome may determine for years to come the course of prices in the $200 billion-a-year global crude-oil market. 
"OPEC either will reach an agreement on workable quotas for all 13 members, or it will face an extended period of sharply lower oil prices," says Paul Mlotok, a Salomon Brothers oil economist. 

   The Saudis could of course change their minds about the wisdom of all-out production. 
They would clearly prefer output controls. 
The kingdom is currently producing an average of 6.7 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva, which at about $10 a barrel brings in roughly $67 million. 
A year ago, when OPEC cheating was much less widespread and the markets were firm at $18 a barrel, the Saudis honored their OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels and yet took in some $77 million a day. 

   Though the Saudis would certainly rather get more money for less oil, OPEC indiscipline won't permit it. 
Five months ago, the United Arab Emirates publicly repudiated its quota. 
Cheating by others became evident -- then flagrant. 
Oil prices stepped slowly downward until finally the Saudis, outraged at the cheating, announced that they, too, would exceed their OPEC quota so long as others did. 
That brought new price declines, which in turn prompted the Saudis to produce still more to meet their mounting internal needs. 

   To accuse Saudi Arabia of being a quota-breaker is unfair, contends Hisham M. Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister and the acting planning minister. 
"When others overproduce and we react to that, that is not overproduction," he says. 
Mr. Nazer declines to comment on the likely results of the OPEC conference or on Saudi Arabia's strategy, nor will he elaborate on the kingdom's production policy. 

   But Mr. Nazer is clearly the man of the hour. 
The Saudi minister heads OPEC's long-term-strategy committee and sits on the cartel's committee on price evolution, groups that will meet jointly. 
Four days hence, on Monday, the regular winter conference of OPEC opens and all 13 members will begin the effort to take official action on the problem of runaway production. 

   Named to his oil post following the ouster of Ahmed Zaki Yamani in the aftermath of the 1986 price crash, Mr. Nazer enjoys the trust of King Fahd, many associates say. 
Though he is the architect of the Saudis' current emphasis on increasing revenue, Mr. Nazer declares that "as long as there is an agreement and as long as there is a commitment, we in Saudi Arabia will be the first to adhere to that agreement." 

   Outside the kingdom, it is assumed that the Saudis' recent opening of the oil spigot is aimed at lowering prices to punish other exporters for their excesses. 
One widely held theory says that the kingdom wants to teach them a lesson so they will return to the OPEC bargaining table chastened. 

   Many believe that the Saudis are particularly keen on hurting Iran because of its long efforts to spread its Islamic revolution to stable Moslem countries. 
Low oil prices are especially painful in Iran, which desperately needs revenue to repair the devastation from its eight-year war with Iraq but which isn't able to increase oil production much. 

   Others speculate that it is really Iraq the Saudis aim to hurt -- even though the kingdom backed Baghdad in the war -- because Iraq's vast undeveloped reserves make it more of an oil-market rival. 
Iraq has substantially raised its production over the past year to about 2.7 million barrels a day, but it isn't part of the OPEC quota system because it won't accept a limit lower than Iran's. 

   Still other theories suggest that the Saudis are after the United Arab Emirates -- chronic quota cheaters -- or that their targets are Britain, Mexico, China and other non-OPEC producers, which gained market share in recent years. 

   But interviews with a number of individuals close to Saudi planning suggest that little, if any, of this is valid. 
The Saudis evidently are embarked on something far simpler than sophisticated petroleum politics. 
The Saudis, these individuals insist, simply need money now. 
Says one source close to petroleum policy in the kingdom: "The game is economic, not political." 

   He notes that as long as the OPEC price was $18 a barrel -- still the target -- Saudi Arabia could comfortably produce within its quota. 
"But once the price drops below $18, we have to produce and market as much as we can," he says. 

   "People accuse us of driving down the price to hurt so-and-so, but that's nonsense," says another Saudi source. 
"We're also hurt. 
We've got a deficit, too." 

   Since 1983, in fact, Saudi Arabia has been running the largest annual current-account deficits within OPEC, according to Petroleum Finance Co. 
"This year will be no exception," the Washington-based consulting firm reports. 
"The kingdom's current-account position is projected to show a deficit of $7.8 billion." 

   Saudi Arabia is by no means in the kind of economic straits faced by fellow OPEC members Nigeria -- with its intractable poverty -- and Algeria -- with its bloody riots. 
With the world's biggest reserves, Saudi Arabia is still among the wealthiest of nations. 
But the oil-price decline has so hurt its revenue outlook as to trigger speculation of a devaluation in the Saudi riyal. 
Currency reserves, once near $200 billion, are down sharply. 

   What's more, the Saudis haven't forgotten the effects of the price war of 1985-1986. 
Formerly acting as the OPEC "swing" producer, cutting its own production when necessary to keep total cartel output within its target range, Saudi Arabia saw its output fall from a peak of 10 million barrels a day to less than three million in a span of seven years. 
Its decision three years ago to raise this depressed production jolted OPEC into a new, though temporary, discipline and gained world market share for the cartel. 

   Yet because of the plunge in prices to the $10-a-barrel level in the spring of 1986, the move didn't increase the Saudis' revenue. 
"They doubled production and yet saw income decline," recalls James E. Akins, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia. 

   Thus, Saudi planners would like to see production restraint in OPEC push up the price to the $16 to $20 level. 
Mr. Nazer is said to believe the higher range could be reached quickly if total OPEC output were held to 17.4 million barrels a day. 
That would equal the current (unobserved) OPEC quotas plus an Iraqi limit equal to Iran's 2.4 million. 
It also would mean a steep cut in OPEC output; it is estimated that the cartel's members now produce a total of 23 million barrels a day. 

   OPEC sources say Mr. Nazer has recommended the 17.4 million ceiling. 
It's understood that he believes such a quota, being well short of demand for OPEC oil, would force users to draw some 3.5 million barrels a day from glutted world inventories during the first quarter of 1989. 

   Such a ceiling would, of course, require a return by Saudi Arabia to its output quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. 
It would also mean no other OPEC member except Iraq would get an increase. 
To bring Iraq back into the fold, Mr. Nazer favors giving Baghdad parity with Iran. 
In fact, he has made clear that Saudi Arabia won't sign any agreement that excludes Iraq, or other OPEC members for that matter. 

   A higher OPEC ceiling of 18.5 million or even 19 million barrels a day, as suggested by several other members, would be acceptable to Mr. Nazer under certain conditions, people familiar with his thinking say. 
His chief condition is said to be that all 13 members share equally in any increase. 

   The Saudi minister is understood to expect that an agreement will be reached. 
If there isn't one, Saudi Arabia intends to implement its decision, already made, to open the taps all the wider. 
Trade sources suggest that even in today's weak oil environment, the Saudis should be able to sell at least seven million to eight million barrels a day. 
Not only are the Saudis now aggressive marketers, they also are developing strong refining links abroad, such as their just-concluded purchase of a half interest in Texaco Inc.'s refineries and filling stations in the Eastern U.S. 

   Even with so much riding on the outcome, the obstacles to an agreement remain formidable. 
Whether Iraq and Iran will agree to identical quotas remains a question. 
There is controversy, too, over how to count production from the Saudi- and Kuwait-administered Neutral Zone, oil that has been going to Iraq as "war-relief." 

   For Mr. Nazer and others who support a ceiling of 17.4 million barrels, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates may be a bigger problem. 
Ecuador, though a tiny producer, is demanding a 33% quota increase. 
And the Emirates, now producing twice as much as their OPEC quota, are intransigent. 
The comment of one Emirates official shows the depth of the problem. 
"It is time for other members to sacrifice," he says.

<HL> New Sears Strategy on Display in Wichita --- In Test Market, The Low Prices Can Seem High </HL>

   The first reaction of a shopper who ventures into the large, two-story store at Towne East Square mall here might be a sense of disbelief: Could this really be Sears? 

   On one wall, foot-tall red letters blast the message: "We've lowered our prices permanently!" 
Similar claims are repeated in a sea of smaller red, white and blue signs that give the store a carnival-like atmosphere. 

   Over in the men's clothing department, Fruit of the Loom men's briefs now sell for the same price as they do at the nearby Wal-Mart discount store. 
In the automotive section, the price tag on a Die-Hard battery is 14% lower than before, and a baby car seat sells for 31% less than the old regular price. 

   The Wichita store offers a glimpse of where Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. wants to be in the 1990s. 
Since Sept. 30, the nation's largest retailer has been testing a new pricing strategy here and at two other stores in the Wichita area. 
And late last month, the company announced it would extend the new approach -- referred to in the trade as "everyday low pricing" -- to all of its 825 U.S. stores starting next year. 

   Not all shoppers, however, are likely to be satisfied with what they find. 
Although Sears's promotion gives the impression of an across-the-board price cut, it is actually doing something a little different than that. 
In general, the new prices won't be quite as low as the former sale prices, though they'll be sharply lower than the old regular prices. 
While that may be good news for regular shoppers, it's unlikely to go over big with bargain hunters who have grown accustomed to Sears's frequent sales. 

   The pricing policy, combined with other new merchandising plans, is the most radical retailing change for Sears in its 102-year history. 
Sears, which helped pioneer the very concept of the "sale," now says it will back away from such promotions, and instead will sell most items at the same price year-round. 

   Over the next few years, Sears also plans to offer far more name brands, which it will sell alongside its own Kenmore and Craftsman lines. 
And the retailer will expand the floor space used for selling in its stores to at least 65% of total store space from the current 51% -- one of the lowest percentages in the industry. 

   Although the new strategy poses many risks, Sears has little choice. 
Its market share has eroded through much of the 1980s, while many of its competitors have grown rapidly. 
Apparently, today's shopper is less willing to put up with higher prices and a more limited selection in order to shop at the store that still has the most trusted name in retailing. 

   Increasingly, consumers have been sending Sears that message by waiting to visit its stores only when the retailer runs sales. 
This year, just 45% of Sears's domestic revenue will come from items sold at the regular price. 
To maintain its business, Sears has been forced to run more and more sales. 
Recently, it has been dropping the price of as many as 8,000 items each month. 

   Now, Sears itself points to a recent survey by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman in which 78% of the respondents said they view "reasonable prices" as an important consideration in choosing a store. 
Sears became more convinced of the need to adopt a new pricing policy when a survey in Wichita found that 81% of the participants said they would shop more often at Sears because of the changes in the stores there. 
Only 1.5% of the Wichita shoppers said they would visit Sears less often. 

   "What {customers are} saying is they like the idea of being able to come into Sears and shop with confidence that they are getting reasonable prices and good value" every day, says Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive at Sears Merchandise Group. 

   Wanda Leek, a 30-year-old telephone service representative, who recently bought about $100 of clothes, jewelry and sheets at the Towne East store, fits that description. 
She says she prefers "steady, low prices" because she works 10 hours a day and doesn't "have time to be watching for sales." 

   Sears is trying to keep the bargain hunters happy, too, by lowering the prices on heavily advertised items so that they are close to or the same as the old sale prices. 
Virginia Belden, who sells vacuum cleaners and sewing machines at the Towne East store, however, frets that some shoppers might miss the thrill of getting a bargain. 
"I worry that people are conditioned to saying, 'I saved $100 on this or that at Sears,'" she says. 

   Adds Linda Alley, a shopper at Towne East mall who expects she'll be visiting Sears less often under the new pricing plan: "I look for something I like, wait for it to go on sale, then get it." 

   Another disappointment for bargain hunters: Mr. Bozic estimates that the pricing change won't affect Sears's overall gross profit margin, which has shrunk this year from an average of 32.8% in 1987 because the company has done more discounting. 
The company's margins in its appliance and tire departments, however, will be under "some pressure," he says, because Sears intends to compete aggressively in those cutthroat markets. 

   Buyers, however, often will find new prices that in many cases will be higher than the current sale prices. 
The DieHard battery in Wichita, for instance, costs $5 more than Sears's old sale price; a Kenmore dishwasher costs $20.99 more. 
Levi's 501 jeans cost $1.97 more than the old sale price, and a Conair hair dryer sells for 97 cents more. 

   Meanwhile, Sears is charging its old sale prices for a 215-piece Craftsman socket-wrench set, a 20-inch boy's bicycle, a Kenmore freezer, a Matchmate twinsheet set, a Sears video camera, and a 26inch RCA television. 

   A spot check of prices in Wichita does show that Sears is generally meeting its goal of setting competitive prices on wellrecognized items. 
Its Levi's 501 jeans, for instance, are priced three cents lower than those at J.C. Penney. 
On a Lego building block set, Sears charges the same amount as Montgomery Ward and Target and only 42 cents more than Wal-Mart. 

   The spread is a bit bigger on other items. 
Sears's $15.96 price on a one-ounce spray bottle of Vanderbilt toilet water is 46 cents higher than Penney's and $2.12 higher than Wal-Mart's. 
For a Dr. Barbie doll, Sears charges $12.99, $1 more than Target and $2.16 more than Service Merchandise Co. 

   Another risk for Sears is losing its own specific identity in an industry full of retailers pursuing a similar strategy. 
Several competitors, including the Target discount unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. and K mart Corp., are flirting with everyday pricing. 
And Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., which began a similar name-brand strategy in 1985, started switching to everyday pricing this fall. 
Wal-Mart also stresses its low everyday prices. 

   Mr. Bozic says Sears has identified roughly $200 million in annual savings related to inventory reductions that will result from the pricing switch. 
Sears will cut the number of items in many lines of merchandise because its new pricing program requires fewer models at varying prices than its previous promotional stance. 

   The idea is to make room for name brands, while increasing the percentage of selling space. 
Indeed, Mr. Bozic says Sears executives view the addition of name brands as "the thing that really drives the revenue" because the wider selection of brands gives Sears "a lot more marketing clout." 

   The introduction of "Brand Central" departments at 13 Sears stores in Indiana last summer, for instance, increased sales of appliances and electronic goods by more than 50% at some locations without hurting sales of the Kenmore house brand, Mr. Bozic says. 
In the Brand Central departments, Sears's selection of upright vacuum cleaners contains the same number of models as before. 
But instead of selling 18 different Kenmore models, it now has 10 Kenmores, four Hoovers and four Eurekas. 

   Mr. Bozic acknowledges that it will take Sears at least two years to put a significant number of new name brands into all of its stores. 
By the end of next year, only about half the stores will contain Brand Central departments. 
Sears is also developing other so-called "power formats" -- departments that contain a big selection of both Sears and name brands -- in auto supplies, carpet, garden supplies, children's merchandise, home furnishings and men's and women's apparel. 

   A new store scheduled to open in Chicago in March could provide the next critical test of Sears's marketing muscle. 
It will contain several "power formats," including Brand Central and a department for women's apparel. 

   So far, Sears has tested only its ability to add name brands to strong Sears brands in appliances and tires. 
These categories appeal to the retailer's traditional male customers, who helped turn Sears's Craftsman and Kenmore brands into bestsellers. 

   But Sears officials realize that the retailer must do more to attract women as regular customers. 
And that promises to be a tall task. 
While 52% of consumers surveyed in March by Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates said Sears was the best place to buy power tools, only 1% said it was the best place to buy a woman's dress blouse.

<HL> Law: U.S. Judge Rules Navistar Liable For Ex-Unit's Pension Obligations </HL>

   A federal judge found Navistar International Corp. liable for unfunded pension obligations of its former Wisconsin Steel unit, even though it didn't own the business when the pension fund was terminated. 

   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that brought the landmark case, said federal Judge James B. Moran found that Navistar sold Wisconsin Steel to avoid paying pension benefits. 

   The agency had sued Navistar to hold the truck maker responsible for about $146 million for the underfunded pension plans, a figure that includes interest since 1981. 
It said the actual damages will be determined by Judge Moran in a supplemental proceeding. 

   Roxanne Decyk, Navistar's senior vice president for administration, said the company hopes it can overturn the decision on its liability in an appeal. 
She said that even though damages haven't been determined, the company "is in a very sound financial position, and we have plenty of cash." 

   The company disputed the $146 million figure cited by the pension agency and added that Navistar was confident it "will have no liability when the legal standards are resolved on appeal." 

   Ms. Decyk also said the company was pleased that the judge found Navistar wasn't liable for pension liabilities after the 1977 sale of Wisconsin Steel, and that he denied claims Wisconsin Steel made against Navistar. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Navistar shares fell 25 cents to $4.875. 
The decision was announced after the close of trading. 

   The case marks the first time the pension agency sought to hold a company liable even though it didn't own the business when the pension plan was terminated. 

   The agency asserted that Navistar, then known as International Harvester, fraudulently tried to avoid or minimize the cost of vested pension rights by selling the unit to Envirodyne Industries Inc. in 1977. 

   Wisconsin Steel later entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, under which a company seeks protection from creditor lawsuits while it seeks to work out a plan for paying its debts. 

   The agency alleged that Navistar knew Envirodyne wouldn't be able to obtain sufficent credit and capital to operate Wisconsin Steel profitably. 

   Gary Ford, general counsel of the agency, said the case shows that it "will move decisively on what we view as abusive transactions, and we will stick to it as long as it takes." 
He added that the agency is "monitoring" several other companies. 
"I hope it's a signal to them that if they attempt schemes that abuse the pension-insurance system, we will hold them accountable," he said. 

   Mr. Ford declined to identify the companies the agency is watching for possible abuses, but added: "If you look at the business pages, you might find some candidates." 

   The pension agency originally brought two suits against Harvester in 1981 and 1982 and they were later consolidated into one action. 

   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. was created in 1974 to guarantee payment of basic retirement benefits earned by workers in defined benefit pension plans. 
Such plans promise to pay specified amounts to retirees after a set number of years at work.

<HL> Merrill Lynch Asks Firms to Bid to Run Internal Network </HL>

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. is asking three big telecommunications providers to bid for the job of managing its $400 million telecommunications network. 

   Some executives at the financial services firm speculate that the new strategy will mean many senior-level employees will lose their jobs. 
About 350 employees work on the Merrill network. 

   The move is similar in some respects to Bankers Trust New York Co.'s decision last summer to sell several departments, and transfer related employees to a Xerox Corp. division in a cost-cutting move. 
Bankers Trust had hired Xerox to manage various office services. 

   Merrill has asked American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., MCI Communications Corp. and U.S. Sprint Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., to provide bids for the entire network as well as separate operations within the network. 
"We've asked them to bid on any piece where they believe they have an exceptional competitive advantage," said Robert Niebanck, director of telecommunications at Merrill Lynch. 
"We want to determine whether or not any vendor or a combination of vendors can provide us the same quality of service we now enjoy more cost effectively." 

   If any jobs are found to be more efficiently provided by a bidder, then the people whose jobs are affected will be redeployed, Mr. Niebanck said. 
"My problem is retaining these high level technical people in a highly competitive marketplace," he said. 

   Merrill executives familiar with the telecommunications operations offer a different view. 
They said the company currently uses a combination of dedicated private lines and public lines to transmit voice, data and video signals. 
The use of the lines is coordinated by an internal technical staff and managers. 
By hiring a company like AT&amp;T or MCI to manage its telecommunications network, the internal managers and technical staff will almost certainly lose their jobs, the executives claim. 

   "Why should an MCI or AT&amp;T use our managers when they're being hired to use their own?" said one senior executive, who asked not to be named. 

   Separately, Merrill chairman and chief executive officer William A. Schreyer said that fourth-quarter earnings estimates will be "pretty much according to analysts' projections" of 45 cents to 65 cents a share in spite of a sharp drop in stock trading volume. 
Gains from the company's fixed securities trading and its investment banking operations "more than made up for the lack of equity business" in the quarter, he said. 

   The estimates don't take into account the positive effect of a previously announced $220 million one-time gain in the fourth quarter from a pension-plan change. 

   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Merrill, the nation's biggest brokerage house, earned $3.5 million, or two cents a share, on revenue of $2.71 billion. 

   Unlike a number of Wall Street firms that have recently tried to encourage retail trading by boosting brokerage commissions, Merrill has no plans to increase commissions, Mr. Schreyer said.

<HL> Industry Focus: Major Auto Makers Bullish About Sales For the Rest of This Year and Early '89 </HL>

   U.S. auto makers are bullish about the prospects for car sales, not only for the remainder of this year but also for early 1989. 

   According to industry sources, the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 13.9% more cars in next year's first quarter than they did a year earlier. 
They also intend to stick with ambitious plans to build 11.6% more cars in the current fourth quarter. 

   The optimism comes amid recent indications of stronger consumer confidence generally, and more-stable short-term interest rates. 
After dropping precipitously in September, consumer confidence rebounded in October, according to the Conference Board, a business study group. 

   Some auto-industry analysts who earlier depicted the auto makers' fourth-quarter forecasts as typical early-model-year hype, now say the industry's plans for the next several months seem reasonable, even though a few worry about General Motors Corp. GM has already had to schedule a temporary closing and production cut at one plant early next year to reduce inventories of some slow-selling compact cars. 

   Industry sources say the auto makers plan to build a total of 1,930,000 cars in the final three months of this year and 1,950,000 cars in the first quarter of 1989. 
The current fourth-quarter forecast is slightly ahead of last month's estimates. 

   "This is not the situation I thought it was six weeks ago," says Ronald A. Glantz of Montgomery Securities, in San Francisco. 
"October and November sales have been much stronger than anticipated." 
U.S. car sales in the first 10 days of November rose 18.8% from year-earlier levels. 

   One possible damper on the enthusiasm is a finding by the Conference Board that, despite the positive signs from the monthly confidence survey, fewer consumers than in September said they plan to buy automobiles in the next six months. 
Some industry analysts warn that this reluctance, paired with the auto makers' optimism, could result in excessive car inventories and lead to a spate of temporary plant shutdowns, or to broad buyer-incentive programs later this year or early in 1989. 

   GM has already announced plans to shut for the first week in January the Lansing, Mich., assembly plant that builds Oldsmobile Calais and Buick Skylark compact cars. 
When the plant resumes operation Jan. 9, the line rate will be cut 25% to 45 cars an hour on two shifts. 
More such cuts and closings could be in the offing if inventory levels of several other models, including Chevrolet's Camaro, Corsica and Beretta cars, don't pull back from late-October levels that teetered at or above a 100-day supply. 

   Still, some analysts say they aren't too worried about GM, even though its overall unsold-car inventories jumped to an estimated 76-day supply at the end of October from 67 as Sept. 30. 
A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered ideal. 

   While GM's plans are ambitious, they say, the auto maker could easily balance production by eliminating scheduled overtime. 
"Personally, I think GM will be right," says Charles Brady, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "Demand will be greater than most people suspect." 

   Top executives at Ford Motor Co. appear to agree. 
Ford continues to be optimistic despite the conflicting economic indicators; its current industrywide sales forecast for 1989 stands at about 10.2 million cars and 5.2 million trucks, says Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling, adding that these estimates reflect "some weakening" from 1988's expected totals, but still represent a "very good" year. 

   The first-quarter output estimate for Ford, down slightly from the 1988 level, partly reflects that expected weakening. 
But the No. 2 auto maker's pattern in recent months suggests that it could increase its forecasts, as it strains to tweak more cars from plants already operating at capacity levels. 
Company spokesmen say all of Ford's North American assembly plants have been working overtime in recent weeks. 
Such overtime throughout the past year helped Ford boost 1988-model car and truck production 19% from 1987 levels, the company said.

<HL> World Markets: Tokyo Ends Bumpy Day With Another Record As London Posts Slight Rise After Rally Falters ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO>
<IN> STK PCS CMD </IN>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo share prices surged in the opening 90 minutes of the morning session Wednesday, ran into profit-taking when the Nikkei index crossed above 29000, then rebounded to recoup most of their initial gains by the close. 
London stocks closed slightly higher after a rally was cut short, while the Frankfurt market was closed. 

   Electricals were among the strongest Tokyo stocks, helped by the return of relative calm to the foreign exchange markets, but traders said buying interest was spread out across the market. 

   Financial issues didn't join the rally, however. 
Most financials have been little changed in the past two sessions after four consecutive days of substantial gains. 

   The Nikkei index added 166.71 points to close at 28996.12, just shy of 29000. 
The Nikkei's close was its highest ever. 
The index broke through to a new high last Friday and has added to the record in each of the past three sessions. 

   The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section edged up 0.83 point to 2234.98. 
First section volume was estimated at 1.2 billion shares, up from 1.08 billion Tuesday. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index gave up 26.09 points, dropping to 28970.03 in the first 15 minutes of trading. 

   Foreign investors provided much of the impetus for Wednesday's early rally, traders said. 
The foreigners came in from the start as heavy buyers of electricals in particular. 

   But the 29000 level for the Nikkei made some investors nervous, and the ensuing wave of profit-taking caused the index to fall into negative terrority for a time. 

   Although pharmaceuticals, foods and asset-backed stocks, among others, attracted interest, "Electricals were the really hot" sector, said one trader. 
NEC rose 60 yen to 1,860 yen ($15.10), while Matsushita Electric Industrial gained 80 to 2,290. 
Sony gained 160 to 5,980, and TDK was up 210 to 4,070. 

   Among pharmaceuticals, Yamanouchi gained 50 to 3,850, while Tanabe Seiyaku was up 50 to 1,710, and Fujisawa rose 60 to 1,600. 

   Financials continued the breather they began Tuesday after providing the lead late last week, and early this week. 

   But the long-lagging financials haven't finished their rally, most traders said, and the market's ability to get along without them is a good sign. 

   "If you can move up without the financials, then when they kick back in you have all the further to go up," said one trader, "and I think they will be back. 
They are simply way too oversold still." 

   London prices finished a moderately active session slightly higher, although sharply off the day's best levels, as the market fell victim to sliding prices on Wall Street. 

   London equities were energized in the early afternoon on news that Britain's General Electric Co. and Siemens of West Germany bid for British electronics giant Plessey, only to shrug off the news and sink lower in tandem with Wall Street. 

   The Financial Times 100-share index finished 5.0 points higher at 1807.3, well below the best level for the day of 1824.4, which came on the heels of the bid for Plessey. 

   The 30-share index was up 16.2 points at 1477.1. 
Volume was a moderate 549 million shares, compared with 344.7 million Tuesday. 
The volume figure was inflated by several trading programs, some dealers said. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 18.85 points at 2058.32 as the London session drew to a close, having been down as much as 24 points during the European afternoon. 

   With the long-awaited release of U.S. trade figures for September holding few surprises, the market squarely focused on the fresh weakness in the dollar. 

   "There's a general feeling that there's now a policy vacuum {in the U.S.}," said Andrew Smith, a U.K. equities analyst at CL-Alexanders Laing &amp; Cruickshank in London. 
The market feels that "the only thing holding up the dollar is the central banks, so there's a strong possibility that interest rates will have to move up in the U.S.," he said. 

   Shares got an immediate, albeit short-lived boost on news of the Plessey bid, with GEC and Siemens offering 225 pence a share in cash. 
Plessey shares closed up 48 pence at 224 pence ($4.05), while GEC finished the day 5.5 higher at 178. 
Plessey ran as high as 239 during the day. 

   Property shares rose strongly. 
One dealer said that Morgan Grenfell was buying after going short on property stocks Tuesday. 
Land Securities rose 7 to 583, MEPC gained 8 to 574, and Hammerson added 8 to 737. 

   In major corporate news, Cable &amp; Wireless said pretax profit rose 20% in its fiscal first half. 
The group's results, however, were at the bottom of a range of forecasts, and the shares fell 2 to 368. 

   Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Stockholm and Milan, and mixed in Brussels and Amsterdam. 

   Lower domestic interest rates nudged Paris stocks higher. 
News of the narrower September U.S. trade deficit was cited as a mildly bullish element as well. 

   Among Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Taipei and Singapore, were mixed in Hong Kong, Wellington and Manila and lower in Seoul and Sydney. 

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. 
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. 
The percentage change is since year-end.

<HL> Forstmann Little, Partners Quit Bidding for RJR; Rales Group Abandons $2.51 Billion Offer for Interco --- Impatient Suitor Indicates It May Try Other Means To Increase Its Holdings </HL>
<AUTHOR> Beatrice E. Garcia and Frank Allen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   A group led by the Rales brothers followed through on its threat and abandoned its $74-a-share, or $2.51 billion, tender offer for Interco Inc. 

   A spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C., investor group said preparations to mail back 29.9 million shares tendered by Interco holders would begin "promptly," perhaps as soon as today. 

   But there were indications that the Rales group still might try to expand its stake in St. Louis-based Interco by other means. 

   For instance, lawyers for Interco said yesterday that they were notified that the Rales group had filed for antitrust clearance to boost its Interco holdings far beyond the 3.2 million shares already owned. 
In addition, lawyers for the Rales group were continuing to monitor certain Interco legal developments in the Delaware courts. 

   Sources close to the investor group said Steven Rales decided to let the tender offer expire because he became impatient at the prospect of further delays in the takeover battle, which began last summer. 
These sources said that, in making the decision, Mr. Rales and his group weren't concerned about the continued availability of financing. 

   "Financing was never the factor," one source said. 
"What worries Steve is the effects of such a long fight on Interco. 
He fears the company may have become damaged goods." 

   Mr. Rales and his brother, Mitchell, were said to be unavailable to comment. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Interco shares fell $1.875 to close at $63.375. 

   Interco, which makes Ethan Allen furniture, Converse sneakers, Florsheim dress shoes and London Fog rain gear, has persistently rejected the Rales group. 
The company's lawyers indicated yesterday that they still intend to defend Interco's "poison pill" takeover defense Nov. 30 in arguments before the Delaware Supreme Court. 

   The poison pill was struck down earlier this month by Delaware's Chancery Court on the ground that it improperly prevented shareholders from choosing between the Rales group's all-cash offer and Interco's own restructuring plan. 

   Interco's pill, designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive, has remained in force while the company pursues its appeal of the Chancery Court ruling. 
In the meantime, the Rales group has been blocked from completing the purchase. 
As of midnight Tuesday, 28,564,723 Interco shares had been tendered, according to the Rales-led group. 
Together with the 3.2 million shares already owned by the investor group, that represented about 89% of Interco's common shares outstanding. 

   Meanwhile, lawyers for the Rales group said they are preparing to file a brief tomorrow on Interco's poison pill appeal, as ordered by the court. 
Interco filed its brief last week. 

   The Rales group's lawyers also have sent a letter to the Delaware Supreme Court, arguing that terminating the tender offer or letting it expire would make Interco's appeal moot. 
But other attorneys said such a case might still be heard because the ruling has an important public impact. 

   In St. Louis, Interco denied causing any delay in the proceedings and rejected the suggestion that Interco's business prospects have deteriorated. 

   Interco added that it expects to continue to pursue its own restructuring plan, which involves the sale of Ethan Allen and some other assets and the payment of special dividends to holders.

<HL> Technology: Texas Leads U.S. In the Emission Of Carbon Dioxide </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bill Paul (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> ENV </IN>
<TEXT>
   Texas produces the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that scientists blame most for the so-called greenhouse effect, according to a new report by Renew America, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental group. 

   The report, called "Reducing the Rate of Global Warming," fingers electricity generation as the single biggest industrial source of fossil fuel emissions, accounting for 33.4% of all carbon dioxide emissions in 1986, with transportation sources and industrial and commercial sources not far behind. 

   According to the report, Texas emitted 154.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 1986, nearly twice as much as second-place California, which emitted 85.2 million metric tons. 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Louisiana finished third through sixth, respectively, each emitting more than 50 million metric tons. 

   Emitting the least amount of carbon dioxide was Vermont, followed by Rhode Island, Idaho and South Dakota, each emitting less than three million metric tons. 

   Texas's top ranking appears to reflect its high number of petrochemical plants. 
Roughly half of all statewide emissions were from oil. 
California's emissions, too, were mostly from oil, while virtually all of Ohio's carbon dioxide emissions came from its coal-burning power plants. 
But while Texas's emissions have about doubled over the past 20 years, California and Ohio have managed to pretty much hold the line, the report notes. 

   The environmental group called for a rapid and large reduction in burning oil and coal. 
They also called for much greater emphasis on energy efficiency and "renewable" energy sources such as solar and wind power. 

   While solar, wind, geothermal and other "alternative" energy sources have never competed financially with fossil fuels, some utility executives say they are starting to be competitive in parts of the U.S. as the technologies improve. 

   Meanwhile, natural gas, a fossil fuel that, when burned, emits only about half as much carbon dioxide as oil and coal, is seen by Renew America as a "bridge" between the fossil fuel-based economy of today and a renewable resource-based economy of tomorrow. 
However, the report doesn't address recent forecasts indicating that significant new demand could cause a natural-gas shortage in the U.S. starting around 1990. 

   Recently, other groups and individuals, including Sens. 
Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) and John Heinz (R., Pa.) acting jointly, have made similar proposals to cut fossil-fuel use. 
Each has been in response to scientific warnings that the earth may be undergoing a rapid warming trend as a result of gases in the atmosphere trapping heat.

<HL> Technology: Pioneer in Treating Heroin Addiction, RNA Researchers Win Lasker Awards </HL>
<AUTHOR> Marilyn Chase (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   A pioneer in the treatment of heroin addiction and two researchers who revolutionized the understanding of ribonucleic acid, or RNA, received the 1988 Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards. 

   The awards are given annually by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation in New York to leaders in clinical and basic medical research. 
The awards carry a $15,000 honorarium. 

   Vincent T. Dole, professor and senior physician at The Rockefeller University in New York, won this year's prize in clinical medicine for work begun in the 1960s that illuminated the physical basis of heroin addiction. 
He also was honored for developing a maintenance treatment program using the synthetic opiate drug methadone. 

   "Methadone allowed physicians for the first time to approach addiction as a medical problem" and not just a criminal or psychological deviancy, Dr. Dole said. 

   Sharing this year's prize in basic medical research are two scientists who in the early 1970s and early 1980s explored the intricate workings of RNA, which is copied from deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, to make proteins in the body. 

   Thomas R. Cech, professor of chemistry, biochemistry and biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, won for discovering that RNA can act as its own enzyme or catalyst as it cuts and resplices itself into the genetic message units that produce proteins. 
Previously it had been widely believed that all enzymes must be proteins. 

   The other scientist, molecular biologist Phillip A. Sharp, discovered that after a gene is copied from DNA to RNA, it can "edit" itself, excising meaningless portions, which he called introns, and resplicing together the substantive part of the genetic code into working messages. 
Mr. Sharp is director of the Cancer Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

   "The big impact of our work has been that we now know how to look at the way genes are regulated," Mr. Sharp said. 
"Changes in gene regulation are important in carcinogenesis and in embryonic development, growth, healing and aging -- and all these regulatory changes involve RNA splicing in one way or another."

<HL> Law: State Court Rules For Insurance Firms On AIDS Regulations </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> INS PHA </IN>
<DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the state insurance commissioner didn't have the authority to issue regulations that sharply restrict AIDS testing of insurance applicants. 

   The regulations, adopted in September 1987, weren't implemented because of court challenges by the insurance industry. 
They were designed to bar insurers from testing for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome except for life and total disability policies with a face amount of more than $100,000. 

   The industry sued to block the regulations by, among other things, challenging Insurance Commissioner Roger Singer's right to issue such regulations without a legislative vote. 
The court noted that its decision was based on the question of the commissioner's authority and not on "the substantive merits" of the AIDS testing regulations or "with the need for their adoption." 

   In their ruling, the justices said, "It is now for the Legislature to decide what, if any, authority it will give the commissioner to regulate the underwriting practices of life, health and accident insurers." 

   William Carroll, president of the Life Insurance Association of Massachusetts, a trade association that was among those that appealed the regulations, said he was pleased with the court's decision. 

   "We feel that we need to be able to apply the same underwriting standards to all insurance applications and all policy holders because that is fair, and the court decision today enables us to continue to do that," Mr. Carroll said. 

   Peter Rice, first deputy commissioner of insurance, said the ruling means "testing is permitted and we can't prohibit it." 
But, he added, "We can try and make sure that tests are done in such a way as to not adversely impact people." 
Mr. Rice added that the commission is considering its options under existing laws governing its authority and intends to issue new regulations involving AIDS testing that will address the issues of confidentiality, informed consent and protection against improper disclosure.

<DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A health maintenance organization accused of refusing to allow enrollment of San Francisco residents for fear of having to pay for AIDS and related ailments, agreed to pay $250,000 in cash and medical services to settle the case. 

   The San Francisco district attorney's office had charged HealthAmerica Corp., a unit of Maxicare Health Plans Inc. of Los Angeles with discrimination and false advertising. 

   The settlement includes an injunction prohibiting the health plan from refusing or canceling memberships or denying services because a person has acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS-related complex or has tested positive for the virus known to cause AIDS. HealthAmerica will pay $125,000 to the city's general fund, and medical services valued at $125,000 will be provided to those referred by the city's department of health. 

   "We aren't admitting responsibility based on our research, but the settlement represented the best way to resolve a difficult and sensitive issue," said a HealthAmerica spokesman. 
"It was a problem Maxicare inherited when it acquired HealthAmerica" in November 1986.

<HL> Dollar's Drop Hammers Stock and Bond Prices --- Takeover Stocks Hurt On Concern Over Bids </HL>

   Takeover stocks, which have been the market's strongest crutch, snapped yesterday. 

   News developments hammered the stocks of several actual targets of announced bids, forcing takeover players to bail out of dozens of other issues amid concern about the overall climate for big deals. 
The selling accelerated in response to a falling dollar and a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about higher interest rates and the buildup of public and private debt. 

   "Things look like they're breaking apart," said Hugh Lamle, co-head of arbitrage at M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc. "People are scared to death today of Greenspan not liking leverage in the system." 

   RJR Nabisco Inc. led the decline on the news before the market opened that a group led by Forstmann Little &amp; Co. is no longer considering upping the ante in the $21 billion brawl for the tobacco and food company. 
Its stock plunged by $4.50 a share to close at $84. 

   Shares of Pillsbury Co. also tumbled $2 to $56 on the disclosure that Grand Metropolitan PLC is threatening to lower its $60-a-share bid if the food company goes ahead with its plan to spin off its Burger King fast-food unit. 

   The next shock came when the Rales brothers announced just after the market opened that they wouldn't accept shares tendered under their $74-a-share bid, due to expire at midnight last night, for Interco Inc. 

   The Rales move further clouded the picture for leveraged buy-outs, because their bid was to have been partly financed with junk bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Moreover, traders said there were recurring rumors about the prospect of indictments or settlements in the government's Drexel investigation. 

   Those were among the most prominent of a group of stocks subject to announced bids that slumped amid concerns about deals in general. 
They included Hospital Corp. of America, down $2.125 to $45.875; West Point-Pepperell Inc., down $1.625 to $41.50; TW Services Inc., down $1.125 to $22.375; and Prime Computer Inc., down 75 cents to $17. 

   Traders said the sudden downdraft in RJR triggered sales of other deal stocks, as takeover speculators scrambled to raise cash to cover losses in positions they had borrowed money to open. 
"You strangle the guys with a 'down 4' in Reynolds, and it makes them run for cover," said one takeover-stock player. 
"A lot of guys were looking for money." 

   Martin Weinstein, another takeover-stock player, worried over the implications of the Forstmann pullout from the RJR contest. 
"This suggests that there aren't as many real buyers. 
The world is just not full of buyers." 

   One contributor to yesterday's weakness was that there have been so many deals, both real and rumored, that they are straining the capacity of the arbitrage community to own them all. 
"The people who own the deal stocks are already filled up. 
You've got $20 billion chasing $80 billion of deals," said Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital Corp. in New York. 

   Whisper stocks, or rumored takeover targets, which have been struggling since last week, also faltered. 
They included: McGraw-Hill Inc., down $2.50 to $58.125; Polaroid Corp., down $1.625 to $34.50; Time Inc., down $2.125 to $97.375; MCA Corp., down $1.125 to $43.875, and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., down $1.625 to $40. 

   Still, some traders said they thought that yesterday's selling presented a good chance to buy downtrodden stocks.

<HL> Mead Corp. Predicts Increase in 1988 Profit As Demand Is Strong </HL>

<DATELINE> DAYTON, Ohio  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mead Corp. is experiencing strong demand for most forest products and continued growth in electronic publishing, which will result in higher 1988 profit, Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   Mr. Roberts declined to make a specific earnings forecast, but he said management is comfortable with analyst estimates for 1988 "in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 a share," excluding gains on asset sales. 

   Those estimates assume fourth-quarter profit of 63 cents to 73 cents a share, all from continuing operations. 
That would compare with year-ago earnings from continuing operations of $34.7 million, or 55 cents a share, and net income of $33.2 million, or 53 cents a share. 

   The estimates indicate net income for 1988 of $5.32 to $5.42 a share, after adding a $1.67-a-share gain from sale of assets in the first nine months. 
In 1987, earnings from continuing operations were $218.2 million, or $3.47 a share. 
Net income was $216.7 million, or $3.45 a share. 

   All earnings per share are on a fully diluted basis, as the company regularly reports profit. 

   Sales for 1988 will be about $4.5 billion despite the sale of two businesses during the year, up from $4.21 billion in 1987, Mr. Roberts said in an interview. 

   Results in the 1988 fourth quarter will be noticeably affected by the sale in August of the company's 50% interest in Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co., Mr. Roberts said. 
That forest-products business was contributing profit at an annual rate of 60 cents to 65 cents a Mead share, he said. 

   As a result of the Brunswick sale, analyst estimates that Mead will earn $3.80 to $4 a share in 1989 could be high, Mr. Roberts said. 
He said profit in that range "is possible, but an awful lot of things would have to go right." 
Brunswick contributed 40 cents to 45 cents a share to operating profit in the nearly eight months Mead owned it this year, officials said. 

   Mead's businesses are faring well, Steven C. Mason, president and chief operating officer, said. 
The white-paper mills have strong order backlogs, he said, and there's good demand for practically all the company's other major products.

<DATELINE> STAMFORD, Conn.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Signal Corp. said it will offer to buy back as many as nine million shares, or 31.5% of shares outstanding, under a "Dutch auction." 

   The offer will begin today and expire Dec. 15. 
The company, which has 28.6 million shares outstanding, will invite shareholders to tender their shares at prices not greater than $51 a share and not less than $44 a share. 

   Chairman Edmund M. Carpenter said the purchase "represents an attractive investment and a prudent use of General Signal's cash balances and debt capacity." 
The company makes instrumentation and control technology for semiconductor production, telecommunications, industrial automation and rail transportation. 

   Based upon the number of shares tendered, General Signal will determine the single price per share within that range that will allow the company to buy as many as nine million shares. 
The offer isn't conditioned on a minimum number of shares being tendered. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, General Signal shares fell 75 cents to close at $43.75. 

   Based on the proposed price range, the purchase of nine million shares could cost between $396 million and $459 million. 

   A spokesman said the company would use about $100 million in existing cash and short-term investments to help finance the offer. 
The balance would be financed from borrowings.

   Chiron Corp., Emeryville, Calif., and Ciba-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland said their Biocine Co. joint venture will begin human tests of a new malaria vaccine. 

   Biocine, which also has developed prospective vaccines for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and strains of hepatitis, will conduct the malaria tests on 30 healthy adult volunteers at the University of Maryland vaccine development center in Baltimore. 
The Agency for International Development and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will sponsor the study. 

   Chiron and Biocine use recombinant-DNA techniques to derive vaccines and diagnostics for various infectious diseases. 
Ciba-Geigy, a pharmaceutical conglomerate, earlier this week announced plans to invest $20 million in Biocine for an 8% stake in Chiron. 

   To date, no effective vaccine for malaria has been developed, Chiron said. 
According to the World Health Organization, there are 215 million cases of malaria world-wide each year.

   Ionics Inc., Watertown, Mass., said it received an unsolicited letter from Cenith Partners L.P. proposing negotiations for Cenith to acquire Ionics for "at most" $20 a share. 

   As reported, Ionics in July rejected a proposal from Cenith to negotiate a purchase of Ionics for $17-a-share in cash and $8-a-share in subordinated debentures. 

   Arthur L. Goldstein, Ionics' president and chief executive officer, called Cenith's latest proposal "another meaningless statement lacking in credibility." 
Ionics added that Cenith's proposal is subject to "financing which is presently unavailable to Cenith." 
Ionics said, however, that its board will consider Cenith's proposal "in due course." 

   Ionics makes purification equipment. 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company closed yesterday at $16.125 a share, up 50 cents. 

   Cenith is a Boston-based investment group that owns about 10% of Ionics' 3.7 million common shares ousttanding.

<HL> Chairman of MMR, Fischbach President And Others Indicted </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury in New Orleans indicted MMR Holding Corp.'s chairman, a company unit and a former officer, as well as the president of Fischbach Corp. on charges of bid-rigging and mail fraud related to work on a federally funded sewage plant in Georgia. 

   The indictments named James R. Rutland, chairman, president and chief executive officer of MMR; Robert P. McCracken, former chairman of Matthews-McCracken-Rutland, a predecessor company; MMR's MMR Corp. (LA) unit, and Alfred R. Manville, president of New York-based Fischbach. 

   The charges allege that in 1981 Fischbach &amp; Moore Inc., a Fischbach unit, got a $21 million electrical-construction contract from Cajun Electric Power Cooperative Inc. through bid-rigging agreements with other bidders including the MMR unit. 

   In New York, an attorney for Mr. Manville said, "this seems to be a fairly desperate government attempt to include {Mr. 
Manville} in a transaction in which he's innocent. 
Hopefully, he'll be vindicated." 

   In a statement, MMR said it was invited by Cajun Electric to bid on the project, but couldn't because of the size of the project and the company's limited bonding capacity. 
"Cajun required performance and payment bonds for the full amount of the contract and our bonding company would not agree to such a large project," MMR said. 
"Our inability to bid was black and white and had nothing to do with Fischbach or the other bidders." 

   The company also said that neither Mr. Rutland, Mr. McCracken nor any other officer of MMR has ever met Mr. Manville. 
The company doesn't deny that it had discussions with other Fischbach representatives regarding the subcontracting of a portion of the work on the Cajun Electric project. 
Matthews-McCracken-Rutland is currently MMR Corp. (LA). 

   MMR, a Baton Rouge, La., mechanical and electrical contractor, said Fischbach subcontracted the work because it wasn't to perform that portion of the project. 
Also, MMR said, in October 1986 it petitioned the General Services Administration to stop Fischbach &amp; Moore from bidding on contracts through its units, after Fischbach &amp; Moore had been barred from bidding stemming from a "bid rigging" charge in 1984. 
A short time later, MMR alleges, Fischbach implicated it in the alleged scheme involving Cajun Electric. 

   In September, the Fischbach unit and a Dynalectron Corp., of McLean, Va., official were indicted on similar charges.

<G> CNG EXE DEF </G>
<TEXT>
   Because bearings are a vital part of any machine, Allied Forces in World War II attempted to knock out Germany's ball-bearing capacity, with only limited success but at tremendous cost to both sides. 
On a single raid on the Schweinfurt plant on October 14, 1943 -- one of 16 such raids -- the U.S. Eighth Air Force lost 82 Flying Fortresses and 600 officers and men. 

   Today, 45 years later, interrupting a nation's bearing supply is a lot easier. 
You just pass a trade bill. 
It is not entirely clear why a legislative body -- in this case the U.S. Congress -- would want to destroy the ball-bearing supply available to U.S. industry. 
But something like that is under way, thanks to last summer's protectionist omnibus trade bill. 

   This bombing raid on the U.S. ball-bearing supply makes use of three different sections of the trade act, one dealing with national security, another with "dumping," and still another dealing with something called "duty drawbacks." 
The one most immediately threatening is the national-security clause, which authorizes the U.S. to sharply restrict imports of a product if overreliance on foreign sources poses a risk to the U.S. defense effort. 
Under new deadlines imposed by the trade act, President Reagan must make a final judgment next Monday on whether to follow a Commerce Department recommendation -- brought about by pressures from domestic bearing producers -- and invoke Section 232 against imported bearings. 

   There is considerable might arrayed within the administration against the Commerce protectionists. 
The Defense Department -- not exactly illiterate on national-security issues -- opposes the measure. 
Indeed, Defense Secretary Carlucci and National Security Adviser Colin Powell have been actively trying to line up bearing suppliers in West Germany and Japan, an effort the 232 action could undermine. 
The fact that the Section 232 restrictions would affect non-defense as well as defense industry supplies reveals it for what it actually is, a pure protectionist ploy. 

   Section 232 isn't the whole story. 
A movement to impose anti-dumping penalties on foreign bearings also has been proceeding through Commerce and the International Trade Commission. 
Preliminary findings that would require anti-dumping penalties averaging some 40% to 80% on foreign bearings already have been made, which means that U.S. importers of foreign bearings must post bonds covering the penalties pending a final ruling early next year. 
"Dumping" judgments are influenced by currency swings, so it is possible to find "dumping" caused by nothing more sinister than the decline of the U.S. dollar in 1986-87. 

   Finally, "duty drawbacks." 
The old law said that a U.S. company using an imported part in a product made for export was entitled to a refund of penalties or countervailing duties paid on the part. 
When companies got around to reading the 1,128-page trade bill they found they no longer had that right, unless they were operating from one of the several foreign-trade zones in the U.S. 
How a one-word change, inserting "not," got into the bill with so little knowledge seems to be a mystery, but it plays hob with American export industries. 
Caterpillar, for example, imports some $30 million to $40 million in bearings annually for its U.S. plants. 
Now it must change its logistics, using imports only in plants in trade zones, or face reduced competitiveness when it ships abroad. 

   The really remarkable thing about all this is that bearings are in short supply. 
Domestic bearing makers are quoting delivery times as long as a year. 
Caterpillar says it is on allocation on some items. 
NTN Toyo Bearing Co., a Japanese firm with plants in the U.S., is being besieged by potential buyers and has lead times of seven to 13 months. 

   If the President approves the 232 recommendation next week, the shortage will worsen. 
It would hit especially hard on so-called "commodity" bearings that are used in a broad variety of industries, from lawn mowers to aerospace. 
In a letter to the Pentagon earlier this year, General Electric wrote: "Based on current backlogs in the bearing industry and its inability to meet its delivery commitments, it would appear that the industry at this time might not be able to come forward and fill the void this proposed regulation would create." 
That was prophetic. 

   George Bush might want to give this matter some thought as he looks for a Commerce Secretary. 
He should ask himself whether he wants a department that promotes commerce or one that conducts Schweinfurt raids on U.S. industry and consumers.

   Aided by heavy federal assistance to thrift mergers, the nation's S&amp;Ls reported a $2.4 billion rise in regulatory capital during September, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said. 

   At thrifts insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., withdrawals exceeded new deposits during September by $1.8 billion, the Bank Board said. 
This was substantially less than the net withdrawals for August of $3 billion, but slightly higher than the $1.6 billion net outflow for September 1987. 

   For retail accounts of less than $100,000, net deposits shrank by $3.9 billion, less than the $4.3 billion decline in the previous month. 
Meanwhile jumbo deposits, those over $100,000, increased by $2 billion, following a $1.2 billion rise in August. 

   Federally insured thrifts closed $23.2 billion in mortgages in September, slightly off the August total of $24.5 billion and 12.6% higher than in September 1987. 
Thrifts issued $20.4 billion in new mortgage commitments, down from $24.1 billion in August but up 7.6% from September of last year.

   Knoll Capital Management L.P. said it started a $14-a-share tender offer for the shares of C3 Inc. it doesn't already own. 

   Knoll, a Delaware limited partnership, previously announced its intention to launch the offer, details of which were disclosed in an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal. 

   Knoll owns 952,000, or 9.6%, of C3's 9.9 million shares outstanding. 
The offer for the remaining shares has an indicated value of about $125 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, C3 closed at $12.50 a share, down 25 cents. 

   The offer is conditioned on, among other things, the tender of at least 4.5 million shares. 
It is scheduled to expire Dec. 15. 
Neither Knoll nor C3 could be reached for comment. 

   Last month, C3, a Herndon, Va., integrator of computer products, rejected a $13-a-share bid from Knoll on the grounds that it was conditioned on the receipt of non-public information about C3.

<HL> Seligmann Partner May Face a Charge By London Exchange </HL>

<DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The London Stock Exchange has prepared an internal disciplinary charge against Robert Harris, senior partner in the British brokerage firm Seligmann Harris &amp; Co., in connection with trades apparently executed on behalf of Ivan Boesky. 

   The London exchange has issued Mr. Harris a copy of the charge, prepared in August and updated last month. 
Mr. Harris is expected to reply, and a disciplinary hearing into the matter may occur in the next few months. 

   The charge marks the latest sign of continuing investigations surrounding transactions allegedly involving Mr. Boesky. 
Last week, British investigators briefed Securities and Exchange Commission officials in the U.S. about new findings in their inquiry into an alleged scheme to support the price of Guinness PLC's shares during the #2.53 billion ($4.57 billion) takeover of Distillers Co. in 1986. 
The investigators also sought additional information from Mr. Boesky in the matter. 

   The British authorities appear close to a decision on whether to bring charges against Mr. Harris, people in the U.S. familiar with the matter said. 
United Kingdom law-enforcement officials have declined to comment. 
Mr. Harris, who declined to be interviewed last week, didn't return phone calls last night to his London office and wasn't available at home. 

   The London exchange's main allegation involves Mr. Harris's execution of transactions in which Seemala Corp., a broker-dealer controlled by Mr. Boesky, guaranteed it would buy back stock sold to Cobalt Holdings Corp., an offshore corporation whose ownership the London exchange hasn't been able to unravel. 
The transactions apparently occurred between January and March of 1986 and occasionally involved roughly $100 million blocks of shares. 

   Seligmann Harris was among several brokerage firms named in SEC subpoenas issued about a year ago in relation to a investigation of stock-parking. 
Parking occurs when one investor buys securities for another who wants to conceal the true ownership of the securities. 

   Seligmann Harris was mentioned but not charged in a complaint against Mr. Boesky's former head trader, Michael Davidoff, who pleaded guilty last year to one felony charge for engaging in a parking scheme with the London firm. 
The government alleged in its indictment that there was "a secret agreement" between Mr. Davidoff and the firm to disguise what the government called "bogus trades."

   A group led by Forstmann Little &amp; Co. bowed out of the record bidding contest for RJR Nabisco Inc., even as the giant Atlanta-based food and tobacco company received an unusual takeover proposal from a group including First Boston Corp. and a company backed by the Pritzker family of Chicago. 

   The developments came two days before tomorrow afternoon's deadline for takeover proposals set by a special committee of the RJR board. 
The two leading bidders for RJR remain the New York buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and a group including RJR management, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc. 
Both have lodged $20 billion-plus bids but are expected to submit new offers by the deadline. 

   The Forstmann Little group, which also included Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Ralston Purina Co. and Castle &amp; Cooke Inc., refused to elaborate on a one-sentence statement that said an RJR takeover wasn't "consistent with its investment criteria." 

   However, according to someone close to the group, the crux of the problem lay with Ralston. 
This person said that Ralston was unwilling to put up enough money for its share of the bid, and other group members were unable to persuade it to do so. 
In the end, the group didn't have enough time to replace Ralston. 
A Ralston spokesman declined to comment. 

   "Everybody was looking at different things, and everybody had a slightly different interest in terms of entering the venture," said a member of the Forstmann group. 
"When we factored everything together, we sort of felt the risk-reward ratio was one where everyone felt like the best thing to do was not proceed. 
It's frankly a little frustrating for us." 

   Dominick Baione, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which had agreed to lead a bank group providing part of the Forstmann bid's financing, said bank financing was in place. 
"We hosted a bank meeting this Sunday, and surprisingly everything went along extremely well," Mr. Baione said. 
"We were doing better than expected. 
From a bank perspective, this thing was going gangbusters." 

   Mr. Baione agreed that a problem was that Forstmann, the industry's largest buy-out firm after KKR, and its partners didn't see adequate returns resulting from an RJR acquisition. 
"These are very conservative guys," Mr. Baione said. 
"The long and short of it is, they sat back and felt a little uncomfortable about the return." 

   Many Wall Street investment bankers had considered the Forstmann bid a long shot because each backer was interested in a different piece of RJR. 
The group's members, all longtime Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. clients, disclosed two weeks ago that they might bid for RJR. "Forstmann had a very difficult three-headed monster," said a person in the RJR camp. 
"None of these guys was interested in the whole except {Forstmann}. 
None of those other companies were willing to get involved in the tangle by themselves." 

   A person close to P&amp;G said the consumer-products giant would continue its quest to acquire RJR assets -- it's said to covet the company's salted snack and margarine businesses -- perhaps by buying them from RJR's eventual purchaser. 

   The new proposal to acquire RJR came from First Boston and a company called Resource Holdings Ltd. Resource Holdings is a New York-based investment banking firm backed by the Pritzkers and billionaire investor Philip Anschutz of Denver. 
The firm made unsuccessful takeover overtures to Western Union in 1986 and ITT Corp. in 1985. 

   In a letter sent to the RJR special committee Tuesday, First Boston and Resource Holdings broached the idea that both would acquire RJR's tobacco business, while First Boston alone would acquire the food business. 
Details of the proposal were sketchy, but First Boston is believed to want to buy the food business with notes rather than cash, sell pieces of the company and pass on some of the proceeds to RJR shareholders. 
Terms of the proposed tobacco transaction weren't even that specific, but Resource Holdings may be interested in buying that business by itself, people with knowledge of the document say, with First Boston providing the financing. 

   The proposal would seem to have little chance for success. 
Any plan that calls for payments in securities rather than cash probably won't sit well with the special committee, which would far prefer a high proportion of cash. 
In any event, First Boston hasn't yet been given any confidential financial information by the committee, which has provided such data to KKR, the management group and Forstmann. 

   Officials at Resource Holdings declined comment. 
First Boston officials didn't return phone calls late yesterday. 

   News of the Forstmann group's exit helped drive down RJR stock $4.50 a share to $84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Fueling the plunge was speculation that without the Forstmann group's presence, KKR and the Shearson-Salomon management group might again seek to join forces on a joint bid for RJR, and make a combined lower bid. 

   That prospect is feared by the special committee, which had privately encouraged the Forstmann group in hopes of promoting a battle that would force higher bids from all three groups. 

   As of late yesterday, no talks were going on between KKR and the management group, and none were planned. 
"We're heading down our own path toward our own bid," an RJR-Shearson adviser said. 
But asked about the prospect of talks with KKR, he added: "We aren't prepared to rule anything out." 
KKR officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 

   Worried about such a joint bid, people close to the special committee underscored the panel's willingness yesterday to reject any bid considered too low. 
Committee members discussed the possibility of extending the deadline for bids to give any other potential suitors time to assemble competing offers.

<TEXT>
   American Health Properties Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif., said it completed a $60 million participating first-mortgage loan to restructure financing of the 175-bed Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah, N.Y. 

   The loan, to closely held Four Winds Inc., owner of the hospital, has an initial term of 10 years and is renewable for two 10-year periods. 
Details weren't disclosed. 

   The mortgage loan is the first by American Health, a real estate investment trust that specializes in hospital investments and owns eight hospitals. 
It hasn't previously arranged a loan of this type. 

   At Sept. 30, American Health had assets of $269.3 million and debt of $72 million. 

   Robert L.B. Diener, president and chief executive officer, said the company has financed the added $60 million from a revolving credit line. 
Mr. Diener said American Health expects to raise $140 million in long-term financing within 30 days through a debt offering under way in Europe and a U.S. bond sale.

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Red Flag for Bush </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<G> EXE </G>
<TEXT>
   By any measure the incipient Bush presidency has been off to a flying start. 
No more so than in the President-elect's frontal assault on the leakers who threatened to undercut Mr. Bush's apparent choice as Chief of Staff. 

   Governor John Sununu, the key to Mr. Bush's win in the New Hampshire primary and a highly successful politician, has long been mentioned as a candidate for Chief of Staff, along with Bush aides Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter. 
But yesterday apparently well-sourced stories appeared in major papers that Mr. Sununu had won. 
Appearing before the President-elect could announce anything, the stories in effect declared open season on Mr. Bush's apparent decision. 

   "Some aides to President-elect George Bush regard Sununu as a risky choice to be White House chief of staff," the Washington Post reported. 
"Sununu has virtually no Washington experience. 
That fact, along with his pronounced ego and aggressive nature, has caused some Bush aides to wonder whether he could work well with Congress and others in the administration." 
Our own columns reported that the choice didn't appeal to Speaker Jim Wright. 
An anti-Sununu storm was brewing. 

   The effect of this kind of leaking is to foreclose options, to sap an administration's team effort and morale, and to undercut the President's own decisions. 
Mr. Bush appears to understand this. 
He has required his aides to sign a "standards of conduct." 
The leakers' provision reads: "I will hold in confidence any nonpublic information provided to me in the course of my duties with the transition and ensure that such information is used exclusively for purposes of the transition." 

   No one should know better than Mr. Bush how Byzantine, self-destructive behavior did much to debilitate the Reagan presidency. 
If decisions are made by infighting through leaks, the presidency will not belong to George Bush; it will belong to the leakers.

   General Electric Capital Corp. said it agreed to purchase an additional stake in FGIC Corp. for $88.3 million, or $18.50 a share. 
General Electric Capital is a unit of General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn. 

   The GE unit, which already owns a 37.9% stake in FGIC, said it plans to purchase an additional 15.8%, or 4,770,000 shares, from J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. 

   J.P. Morgan said it would realize a pretax gain of about $37.5 million upon closing the sale of its FGIC shares. 
The transaction is expected to be completed before year end or in the first quarter of 1989. 
A spokesman for J.P. Morgan said that although the investment in FGIC "met all our expectations," regulatory restrictions limited J.P. Morgan's ability to "participate in the conduct and growth of the company's business." 

   Other major institutional shareholders in FGIC, which insures municipal bonds, include General Reinsurance Corp., Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
About 19% of FGIC's common stock is publicly traded. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, FGIC shares closed at $18.25, down 25 cents.

<HL> Economy: Trade Deficit Narrowed to $10.46 Billion In September, Helped by Rise in Exports </HL>

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's trade deficit narrowed to $10.46 billion in September as exports rose and imports fell modestly, the Commerce Department said. 

   The shrinkage, which followed a substantial widening in the gap to a revised $12.27 billion in August, suggested that the long-run improvement in the massive deficit is back on track. 
The U.S.'s deficit in trade of manufactured goods improved, as did its bilateral gaps with Japan, Western Europe and the newly industrialized countries of Asia. 

   At the same time, the magnitude of the deficit and the continued high level of imports underscored the likelihood that further progress will be erratic and slow. 
Economists generally expect a narrowing in the total trade deficit for this year to around $130 billion or $135 billion from $170 billion in 1987. 
But many expect only a slight further reduction next year unless there is a substantial drop in the value of the dollar or a slowdown in the U.S. economy. 

   "The improvement was good but not good enough," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. 
"We can't mount another big improvement in trade unless imports go down a lot more, and if the economy remains strong we're going to continue to suck in huge amounts of imports." 

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called the report "welcome news because it is a further indication that the trade deficit is correcting." 
But, he said, that deficit "is still too high." 

   Although the report was generally in line with financial market expectations, the dollar and the stock and bond markets all declined after its release. 

   Imports, including the cost of insurance and freight, declined 2.8% to $38.67 billion in September, after a 10.5% rise the month before, on lower purchases of a variety of consumer and capital goods. 
The volume and price of oil imports both fell, but imports of cars and airplanes rose. 

   Exports rose 2.6% to $28.2 billion after a 3.7% rise in August; items posting higher shipments included cars, office machines, chemicals and clothing. 
For the first nine months of the year, the trade deficit narrowed to $102.87 billion from $127.34 billion a year earlier, with exports up 29% and imports up 8.2%. 

   "Export growth is very strong year over year," Mr. Sinai said. 
"That suggests good times ahead for American manufacturers but also suggests continuing increased inflationary pressures." 

   Excluding insurance and freight charges, the deficit narrowed to $8.97 billion from a revised $10.65 billion, with imports falling to $37.17 billion from $38.14 billion and exports rising to $28.2 billion from $27.49 billion. 

   While the U.S.'s bilateral deficits with most major trading partners narrowed, the gap in trade with Canada swelled after a significant narrowing in August. 
Auto imports from Canada rose, among other items. 

   Except for the figures on bilateral trade, the numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations. 
Before seasonal adjustment, the September trade deficit narrowed to $10.5 billion from $12.83 billion. 

   The seasonally adjusted August deficit was previously reported as $12.18 billion, with imports, including insurance and freight, at $39.72 billion and exports at $27.55 billion.

<TEXT>
   Intrex Financial Services Inc., Lawrence, Mass., and Neworld Bancorp Inc., Boston, said they terminated their agreement for Neworld to acquire Intrex for $18.50 a share, or about $80 million. 

   The two bank-holding companies said in a joint statement that termination of the agreement was caused by a "softening in the real estate market, which adversely affected many thrifts in New England and the financial performance of Intrex." 
The companies also said regulatory approval for the acquisition would be difficult. 

   As previously reported, the companies said in September that they were uncertain whether the acquisition would be completed because Neworld believed it unlikely that Intrex could meet the closing conditions of the agreement. 

   Separately, Neworld said its board approved the repurchase of as many as 350,000 shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions over the next six months. 

   The holding company currently has 4.6 million shares outstanding.

<HL> REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial) -- Asides: Setting Aside Savimbi </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> AFRIC LATAM FREST </CO>
<G> EXE CNG </G>
<TEXT>
   State Department mediators have just announced they are about to close a deal involving the Cuban legions in Angola. 
This time the U.S. better read the fine print. 
Otherwise it could end up consigning Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to the wolves. 

   Cuba, Angola and South Africa have reached tentative agreement on a plan to give Namibia independence while 57,000 Cuban troops begin to leave neighboring Angola. 
The problem lies with the asymmetry in the timing of the two actions. 
Three months after the agreement is implemented early next year, 7,500 U.N. troops will be in Namibia and all but a handful of South Africans will be gone. 
However, only about a quarter of Cuba's troops will be out of Angola. 

   The Marxist Angolan regime recently promised to "annihilate" Mr. Savimbi's UNITA rebels. 
Next summer, with 35,000 Cuban troops still in Angola, they could move in for the kill. 
The agreement stipulates that Cuban troops can't move south into UNITA territory, but we can't help but notice that the Soviets, the Geneva accords in their pockets, are flying Backfire bombing raids against the Afghan mujahideen. 
Mr. Savimbi's supply routes are easily cut off, and the $15 million a year the U.S. provides is dwarfed by the $1 billion in arms the Soviets and Cubans gave the Angolans last year. 

   State believes the Angolans will agree to talks with Mr. Savimbi once an agreement is signed. 
Senator Dennis DeConcini and 50 colleagues (including 21 Democrats) aren't buying that. 
Last month they sent President Reagan a letter warning that "the lessons of Afghanistan cannot be ignored in Angola." 
The Soviets now insist the Geneva treaty denies the U.S. any right to resupply the mujahideen. 
The Soviets continue to arm their puppet regime, and their troop withdrawals have been halted. 
The Senators called all this "the consequences of a settlement that did not include indigenous resistance movements," and urged President Reagan to insist Mr. Savimbi be brought into the negotiations while the U.S. still has leverage. 

   If next year the Angolans are still bent on destroying Mr. Savimbi rather than talking with him, President Bush should consider supplying him with as much military aid as he needs. 
That may well be the only negotiating tactic the Angolans and their Cuban handlers respect.

<HL> Your Money Matters: Funds' Payout Promises May Be Hollow </HL>
<AUTHOR> Michael Siconolfi (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> FND </IN>
<TEXT>
   Growing numbers of stock funds are making a hot sales pitch: they are promising investors a minimum annual payout of 10% or so. 

   Sounds good. 
But the vaunted payout presents a problem for investors. 
It may actually come out of their own pockets. 

   Latest to begin making such promises is the Blue Chip Value Fund, which announced a 10% payout program Friday. 
Others with such strategies include the Gabelli Equity Trust, Liberty All-Star Equity Fund and Zweig Fund. 

   More stock funds are likely to jump on the payout bandwagon. 
They have plenty of incentive to do so. 
Investors are irate about the performance of closed-end stock funds, which have enjoyed enormous popularity among small investors but continue to trade at steep discounts to the value of their portfolios. 

   A soon-to-be-released study by the Securities and Exchange Commission staff will assert that closed-end stock funds typically plunge 25% in their first four months of trading -- a much steeper drop than the 7% bite caused by underwriters' fees alone. 

   The only stock funds making payout promises are the closed-end variety. 
Closed-end fund shares are issued once and traded on the open market, and so aren't strictly tied to the value of their stock portfolios, as open-end fund shares are. 

   After the payout policies are announced, the discounts of many funds narrow as investors are cheered by the "guaranteed" return. 

   But the payouts, typically called distributions, can be misleading. 
That's because a fund, if it doesn't earn sufficient income to cover the promised return, basically gives back investors some of their own money. 

   The tactic rankles some fund specialists. 
"If I'm giving you my money to manage because I think you're a great equity manager, then manage my money -- don't give it back to me," says Anthony Marchese, managing director of Weatherly Capital Corp., a New York-based investment advisory firm. 

   Here's how a typical payout program works: Investors are first guaranteed the cash distribution (often 10%) of the per-share value of the fund's portfolio. 
If the total of net investment income, net short-term capital gains and net long-term capital gains doesn't equal the target, then the fund will distribute the remainder as a tax-free return of capital. 

   Partly because payout promises are relatively new, funds so far haven't had to dip into shareholders' pockets to meet their yield goals. 

   Moreover, fund managers say they expect to be able to generate sufficient income to avoid dipping into fund assets. 
And if not, they add, there's nothing stopping investors from reinvesting the returned cash with the fund. 

   Thomas Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds, says of the strategy: "Whether or not it works, the tendency is for it to narrow discounts, and that serves the interests of shareholders." 

   But if a fund did have to distribute assets to meet its goal, Mr. Herzfeld says, an investor might not understand the fund's yield. 
The confused investor, he says, would be much like a depositor of $100 in a savings bank who earned 5% interest and then withdrew the $5 in interest plus an additional $2 at the end of the year -- mistakenly calculating his "yield" as 7% although the account balance fell to $98. 

   Some funds take a dim view of payout promises. 
The board of Clemente Global Growth Fund recently rejected the idea because, says fund president Leo Clemente, "It didn't make sense." 

   The strategy could cause tax headaches for investors. 
If, say, investors receive a 50 cent return of capital on a $10 stock, they don't have to pay taxes on the 50 cents -- but must adjust the fund's cost basis by that amount. 
Then, if the holder later sold the stock at $10, an additional 50 cents of capital gains would be taxed. 

   And there are other potential problems. 
Weatherly Capital's Mr. Marchese contends that the policies could force fund managers to avoid riskier stocks and become a bit more defensive, selecting higher-yielding stocks to generate more income. 

   Not so, say many managers of funds with promised payouts. 
The latest portfolio to adopt the policy -- the Blue Chip Value Fund -- won't change a thing, maintains Larry Luchini, fund manager. 

   Others believe that the lure of promised payouts will fade. 
The more funds that make payout promises, the less powerful the strategy is going to be in narrowing share-price discounts, says Steven Samuels, editor of Deep Discount Digest, a Santa Monica, Calif., newsletter published by Drake Capital Securities Inc. Says Mr. Samuels: "The bloom is off the rose."

   Miller Brewing Co. said it withdrew its $30 million Miller High Life account from the ad agency J. Walter Thompson Inc., and asked Chicago-based Leo Burnett Inc. to create advertising for the Milwaukee brewer's ailing flagship brand. 

   Burnett already handles advertising for Miller Lite Genuine Draft, which is being test marketed in four cities. 

   A spokesman for Miller, a unit of New York-based Philip Morris Cos., said the switch to Burnett was made to seek "maximum support for the Miller brands," but declined to elaborate. 
Miller High Life market share has fallen in recent years. 

   Thompson, a unit of WPP Group PLC of Britain, will continue with the accounts for Lowenbrau and Matilda Bay Cooler, which Miller markets, and also has been asked to create ads for an "important undisclosed" new product, which Miller declined to say when it would introduce. 

   Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. of Britain, will continue to handle ads for Miller's two largest accounts, Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft.

   Directors of George Bush's transition team said they will meet with the president-elect today to review a short list of candidates for "two or three" key cabinet posts. 

   The comments by co-directors Robert Teeter and Craig Fuller suggest that more personnel announcements may be in store before the Bushes leave for a Thanksgiving holiday in Maine next week. 

   Expected next is the appointment of retiring New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as chief of staff. 
But Mr. Bush's aides have also said the president-elect hopes to fill the top economic and foreign policy posts as quickly as possible, suggesting that appointments of an Office of Management and Budget director, defense secretary and possibly national security adviser or Central Intelligence Agency chief will follow soon after. 

   In a meeting with reporters yesterday, Messrs. 
Teeter and Fuller also elaborated on Mr. Bush's transition plans. 
They announced additions to a paid staff that is expected to number about 100 eventually and distributed a list of ethics requirements that all members of the transition team will be required to meet. 

   Among the names added to the transition team are Fred Fielding, Mr. Reagan's former White House counsel, who will serve as transition director for Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and First Lady Barbara Bush. 

   Among the requirements expected of transition team members are to "hold in confidence any nonpublic information provided . . . in the course of {their} duties with the transition and ensure that such information is used exclusively for purposes of the transition"; to avoid using any "nonpublic" information for purposes of private gain; and to disqualify themselves from involvement in any matters that may conflict with their own financial interests or those of family or business partners. 

   Messrs. 
Teeter and Fuller sought to contrast the Bush transition effort with that of the Reagan administration's, which eventually involved about 1,500 individuals. 
Mr. Fuller said, "It has been George Bush's conclusion that we are engaged in a takeover, but in a friendly takeover." 
He added, "We are not going to send large teams of people around town" and that small groups of perhaps two or three people would be assigned as a liaison to each department. 
These departmental meetings are expected to begin shortly. 

   The two men said the new ethics requirements weren't set out in response to any specific incident or problem but rather to underscore what they said was Mr. Bush's emphasis on ethics and "standards of public conduct" during his campaign. 

   Meanwhile, additional names continued to surface for top administration jobs yesterday. 

   Former Texas Sen. John Tower, who served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, remains the leading candidate to become defense secretary. 

   Conservatives have expressed some dissatisfaction with him, in part over his role at the Republican convention in blocking platform language that hard-liners wanted on the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
But some conservative activists also acknowledge that they don't know of a good alternate candidate they can propose. 

   Mr. Bush still could pick someone else if he wants a defense chief who would be less likely than Sen. Tower to rival Secretary of State-designate James Baker in foreign policy deliberations. 
Paul O'Neill, chairman of Aluminum Co. of America, has been mentioned as a possible alternative. 

   The leading candidate to become national security adviser is believed to be retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who held the job in the Ford administration. 
Gen. Scowcroft is a longtime Bush friend and adviser. 

   House Republican leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.) has signed a letter to Mr. Bush urging the president-elect to pick Rep. E. Thomas Coleman, a Missouri Republican, as agriculture secretary. 

   Also, Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.), a staunch Bush campaign supporter, is a candidate to become labor secretary, Republican lawmakers said. 
And James Robinson, chairman of American Express Co., is believed to be a candidate for commerce secretary.

   Louart Corp., a Los Angeles investment firm, said it raised its stake in Certron Corp. to 32.2% of the common shares outstanding and requested increased representation on Certron's board. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Louart said Marshall Kass, president of Louart, met Nov. 4 with Edward Gamson, chairman and chief executive officer of Anaheim, Calif.-based Certron and asked that Louart be given two more board seats. 
That would expand Louart's representation to four seats. 

   At the meeting, Mr. Kass also told Mr. Gamson he wanted to assume the position of chief executive for Certron. 
He also said Louart didn't intend to seek a merger or a transaction to take the company private. 

   Louart said it holds 985,700 Certron common shares, including 15,000 acquired Sept. 26 for $2.01 each and 12,000 shares purchased Oct. 14 for $1.93 a share. 

   Mr. Gamson declined to comment. 
Certon is a maker of consumer magnetic tapes and related products.

<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc., Denver, said it heads an investor group seeking to acquire CVN Cos. for cash and debt totaling $18 a share. 

   The nation's largest cable company already owns about 17.2% of the common shares outstanding of CVN, a Minneapolis-based home-shopping and retailing concern. 
CVN said its board would meet "in the near future" to review the bid. 

   Tele-Communications said it anticipated the group would include one or more of the other cable-TV system operators that are stockholders or warrant holders of CVN. 
But the company said it didn't have any agreements with potential participants. 

   The offer would pay $14 in cash and a subordinated debt security with a face value of $4 for each CVN common share. 
Peter Barton, senior vice president of Tele-Communications, declined to estimate the total dollar value. 
Earlier this month, the company's president estimated that acquiring the rest of CVN would cost about $175 million. 
In national over-the-counter trading, CVN rose 37.5 cents to close yesterday at $15.375 a share.

   Avalon Corp., New York, said it agreed with Australian Gas Light Co., its major stockholder, to seek a buyer for all Avalon stock for more than $7.25 a share. 

   Australian Gas, Sydney, has been trying to sell its 40.3% stake in the oil and gas exploration company since August. 

   Australian Gas agreed that until April 30 it won't sell its Avalon stock unless there is an offer to buy all Avalon shares outstanding for more than $7.25 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Avalon closed at $5, up 25 cents a share. 

   Australian Gas also agreed to pay $18.6 million for Avalon's 10.1% stake in TMOC Resources Ltd., raising the Sydney company's stake in TMOC to 90%. 
Avalon said it will report a $4.5 million gain in the fourth quarter as a result of the sale. 

   The agreement also calls for two Australian Gas directors to become Avalon directors, increasing the board to eight members. 
Maurice J. Williams, the Sydney company's chief executive officer, already is an Avalon director.

   General Motors Corp. has begun a recall of almost 500,000 1985 Chevrolet, Pontiac and GMC cars and trucks to repair the emission-control systems, the Environmental Protection Agency said. 

   The EPA ordered the recall last March after agency tests showed the vehicles exceeded emission standards for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. 
Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen available to human tissue, while hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, which is particularly harmful to people with respiratory illnesses. 

   In March, the agency said the problem wouldn't necessarily be solved by GM's suggested replacement of a thermal-vacuum switch, a part of the emission-control system. 
GM challenged the order and requested an administrative hearing. 
Since then, additional testing has convinced the EPA that replacing the switches is sufficient, and GM has withdrawn its request for a hearing. 

   The affected models are Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic, Camaro, Monte Carlo and El Camino; Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville, Grand Prix and Parisienne; and the GMC Caballero. 
GM will install new switches at no cost to owners. 

   A GM spokesman confirmed the recall and said the company was notifiying owners immediately. 

   About three million 1982-1985 models have previously been recalled for similar problems, the agency said.

   A federal court ruled against Saudi arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi in a dispute over the ownership of three pieces of Manhattan real estate. 

   Because Mr. Khashoggi failed to appear in the proceeding, Judge Pierre Leval dismissed a complaint that sought to enforce Mr. Khashoggi's control over the offshore corporations that own the buildings in dispute. 

   Specifically, Mr. Khashoggi failed to respond to charges that his alleged interest in the companies was fraudulently obtained. 
The dismissal undermines the claim that Mr. Khashoggi purchased the corporations and the properties from Ferdinand M. Marcos, the former head of state of the Philippines, lawyers in the case said. 

   Two other interests continue to fight for control of the properties: the Philippine government and New York Land Co., a real estate concern owned by Joseph and Ralph Bernstein. 

   The Philippine government is seeking to recover assets of Mr. Marcos, claiming that he looted the government; New York Land, which managed the Manhattan properties for Mr. Marcos, said it contracted to purchase the offshore corporations from him in 1985. 

   The Philippines claimed in court filings that "Khashoggi's interest in the properties is actually based on an agreement between Marcos and Khashoggi . . . to conceal Marcos' interests in the properties by having Khashoggi front as the owner." 

   The claims by the Philippines and of New York Land both depend on showing that Mr. Marcos, rather than Mr. Khashoggi, owned the properties. 
Philip Carter, general counsel for New York Land, said, referring to the court decision against Mr. Khashoggi, "One-third of the triad is gone." 

   The properties in question are 40 Wall Street, a 70-story skyscraper; the Crown Building, a Fifth Avenue office building, and Herald Center, a 34th Street mall. 
The properties have been frozen by a court order since March 2, 1986, one week after Mr. Marcos was removed from power. 

   The charge by the Philippines that Mr. Khashoggi acted as front man for Mr. Marcos parallels the charges in a recent federal racketeering indictment against Messrs. 
Marcos and Khashoggi. 

   The plaintiffs in the civil suit were the three offshore corporations. 
They were represented by Karl Peterson, identified by the judge as an agent of Mr. Khashoggi. 

   The suit charged New York Land with mismanaging the properties. 
It asked for damages and asked the court to declare that New York Land's contract to purchase the properties was unenforceable. 

   Andrew Levander, an attorney for the offshore companies, said, "No one has made a determination as to who owns these buildings." 
And he added that Mr. Peterson continues to be an officer for the companies. 

   Mr. Carter, of New York Land, said, "to us, the effect of decision is that Kashoggi/Marcos isn't the owner. 
It recognizes the Bernsteins' ownership." 

   Jeffrey J. Greenbaum, an attorney for the Philippines, vigorously disputed that assertion. 
He contends that the Bernsteins and New York Land "don't have any rights" to ownership. 

   In a separate civil case pending before the same court, the Philippines asks that the freeze on the property continue until the nation wins a judgment giving it title to the sites.

   The dollar's deep slump and fears that foreigners may reduce their U.S. investments sent bond prices into a tailspin yesterday. 

   U.S. Treasury bonds fell especially sharply. 
Actively traded government bonds tumbled about a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount. 
That was their biggest setback since Nov. 4. 

   Late in the day, benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 9.11%, the highest level since late September and up from 9.01% Tuesday. 
Corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bond yields also rose. 

   The dollar's woes added to traders' fears about how investors, especially foreigners, will react to the Treasury's auction today of about $9 billion of new 30-year bonds. 
In the past, foreign investors, especially Japanese institutions, have purchased huge amounts of long-term Treasury issues. 
But this time the dollar's weakness may frighten away many institutions. 

   A lower dollar also means higher prices of imported goods in the U.S., contributing to inflation pressures. 
If the dollar continues to drop, the Federal Reserve may react by raising short-term interest rates further to attract investors. 

   Many analysts expect the Fed to act by year end. 
That, in turn, would probably mean that U.S. banks would raise their prime, or base, lending rates, which have stood at 10% since August. 
Rates on short-term Treasury bills, which have risen sharply over the past week, were mixed yesterday. 

   Bond prices began to slide early in reaction to the dollar's weakness after the government released its September trade report. 
The trade deficit narrowed to $10.46 billion in September from a revised $12.27 billion in August, as expected. 

   Bonds continued to slump after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the continuation of foreign capital inflows at current levels is "questionable." 

   Mr. Greenspan said evidence for the U.S. and most other industrial nations over the past century indicates that "such sizable foreign net capital inflows have not persisted and, hence, may not be a reliable substitute for domestic savings on a long-term basis." 

   Mr. Greenspan, as usual, didn't indicate if the Fed is planning to tighten credit. 
But many analysts say the Fed won't have any choice if the dollar continues falling and the U.S. economy continues expanding at a brisk pace. 

   "The prevailing market sentiment is still negative about the dollar," says Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. 

   Nevertheless, Mr. Pardee and several other financial executives expect Japanese investors to buy large amounts of the new 30-year bonds today. 
One reason: U.S. government issues now offer much higher yields than comparable Japanese bonds. 

   For example, Japanese bonds due in about 10 years yield about 4 5/8%, compared with 9.01% on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes and nearly 9 1/8% on 30-year Treasury bonds. 
Mr. Pardee estimated that Japanese investors will buy about 30% of the new 30-year Treasury bonds to be sold today. 

   Speculation has been growing all week that U.S. banks may raise their prime rate soon. 
But most bankers say they are awaiting a further move by the Fed. 

   Treasury Securities
   Treasury bonds finished very close to their lowest levels of the day. 

   The government's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 fell to 100 1/8, a loss of 1 1/32 point, from 101 5/32 late Tuesday. 
The yield rose to 9.11% from 9.01%. 

   The government's new 10-year notes dropped 5/8 point to 99 3/32 from 99 23/32 Tuesday. 
The yield rose to 9.01% from 8.92%. 

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 10.10 points to 1235.73. 
It finished just above the low of 1235.04. 
The high was 1248.56. 
The total return so far this year on the bonds in the index is 7.03%; that includes both price changes and interest income. 

   Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted at 7.90% bid, down from 7.94% Tuesday. 
But the latest six-month bill rate was unchanged at 7.96% bid. 

   Calculated on a bond-equivalent basis, the latest three-month bill yields about 8.15%, while six-month bills return about 8.39%. 

   Municipal Issues -
   Municipal bonds fell in reaction to a soft dollar and lower Treasury bond prices. 

   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 fell about 3/8 of a point to 94. 

   Prices of New York state short-term obligations tumbled on Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.'s announcement that it placed the state's debt obligations on CreditWatch with negative implications. 
New York state tax and revenue anticipation notes were quoted late in the day at a price to yield 6.35% and offered at a price to yield 6.25%. 
At one point earlier, they traded at 6.39%, according to traders. 
Late Tuesday, the notes were bid to yield 6.10% and offered at 6%. 

   New York City revenue anticipation notes, which suffered along with short-term state obligations on name association, also pulled off their lows. 

   Longer-term New York state issues were only mildly affected by S&amp;P's action. 
The reaction was mitigated in part by the dearth of available state bonds, some traders said. 

   Maury Cooper, vice president with S&amp;P, said New York state's obligations will remain on CreditWatch "until there's a clear indication from the state as to what action they're going to take." 
The state legislature reconvenes at the end of the month and "we hope they will quickly take up discussion of how to address" this year's $994 million budget deficit and the gap that S&amp;P expects to emerge the following year, Mr. Cooper said. 

   Corporate, Other Issues
   Israel kicked off the second phase of a debt refinancing program with the sale of $2.25 billion of securities. 

   Meanwhile, corporate bond prices finished the day 1/8 to 1/2 point lower in light trading. 

   Underwriters said the large Israel offering was meeting keen demand even on a day when credit markets in general were weak. 
Many portions of the Israel offering were priced at smaller spreads against Treasurys than originally expected. 

   This sale, like one in late September, allows Israel to refinance higher-cost military loans that were made by the U.S. government to Israel. 

   These transactions also allow the U.S. government to get those loans off its ledger and into the hands of the private sector. 
These certificates, though, do have 90% of the interest and principal backed by the U.S. government, with the remaining 10% collateralized by U.S. government securities. 

   So far, only Israel and Tunisia have taken advantage of the refinancing program. 
Turkey is said to be preparing an issue that could be sizable. 

   The Israel issue was priced to yield from 9.01% in 1991 to 9.415% in 2002. 

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. increased the coupon rate on the mortgage securities it auctions daily, signaling higher mortgage rates for consumers. 

   Freddie Mac raised the coupon on its 30-year mortgage securities to 10% from 9 1/2% at its afternoon sale. 

   The move resulted from the decline in the mortgage securities market during the past two weeks. 
Active mortgage issues are down about two points since Oct. 31. 

   Freddie Mac offered to pay loan originators 10.20% for 30-year mortgages deliverable within 10 days, up from the low of 9.82% on Oct. 31. 

   Freddie Mac takes mortgages it buys from originators and resells them to investors as mortgage securities. 

   Freddie Mac's action could prefigure an increase in the Veterans Administration's mortgage rate ceiling to 10.5% from 10%. 
The VA cut its ceiling for guaranteed loans to 10% from 10.5% on Nov. 1. 
Freddie Mac usually acts before the VA. 

   In the pass-through market, prices were off 1/4 to 1/2 point, as active issues held up better than Treasurys. 
Ginnie Mae 9% securities for December delivery ended at 94 1/2, down 14/32; 9 1/2% securities at 97 10/32, off 12/32; and 10% securities at 100, down 12/32. 

   The 9 1/2% securities yielded 10.02% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the yield spread above the 10-year Treasury note narrowed two basis points to 103 basis points. 

   Late in the day, a $500 million issue of Freddie Mac Remic mortgage securities was offered in 13 classes by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
The offering, Series 23, brings Freddie Mac's Remic volume to $11.8 billion. 
The issue is backed by Freddie Mac 10% securities. 
Remics are real estate mortgage investment conduits. 

   Foreign Bonds
   British government bond prices drifted slightly lower in light activity. 

   Prices rose early in the day but then turned down as U.S. Treasury bonds fell in reaction to the falling dollar. 

   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 fell 6/32 of a point to 115 25/32 to yield 9.67%. 
Among shorter-term bonds, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 was down 4/32 to 101 22/32 to yield 10.81%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 fell 6/32 to 107 18/32 to yield 10.30%.

   Summa Medical Corp., Albuquerque, N.M., said it signed a seven-year joint venture agreement with PT Astra International Inc. calling for the companies to make and market latex gloves. 

   Terms of the venture call for Astra, based in Jakarta, to invest $32 million to build a manufacturing facility in Indonesia and Summa to spend $22 million to equip the facility. 
Astra also will supply the raw rubber for the gloves. 

   Summa said the plant, which is expected to begin production next September, should have initial capacity of 100 million gloves a month. 
Summa said it has the exclusive right to buy and market the gloves and said it expects to spend about $5 million to set up a marketing organization. 

   The company, which used to be in the pharmaceutical business, sold its businesses last year and has about $8.5 million in capital to reinvest. 
It said it believes it has the financing to fund its portion of the glove manufacturing effort.

<HL> Law: Law Students Use Job Hunt To Aid Homeless Shelters ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   Law students at top schools are spending much of their fall on job-hunting trips sponsored by law firms eager to pamper them with gourmet dinners and rooms at luxurious hotels. 

   This year, however, more than 600 students from Harvard Law School and 125 law firms have agreed to cut down on the opulence and donate the savings to homeless shelters. 
The anticipated donation this year: about $50,000. 

   Under the plan, sponsored by a student group, the students are staying at hotels that charge less for a room than those normally booked by the law firms. 
The firms then contribute the difference to homeless shelters in their cities. 

   According to Bill Sarraille, a third-year Harvard Law student who is helping coordinate the project, an additional $20,000 is being raised through an arrangement with Filene's Travel Service in Boston. 
When students book flights with Filene's, half of each commission is donated by the travel agency to Boston-area shelters, Mr. Sarraille says. 

   Students at Yale and Stanford law and business schools have already agreed to set up a similar program next year, and Mr. Sarraille expects to sign up three other universities as well. 
Mr. Saraille anticipates that, in coming years, the students will generate $250,000 annually for homeless shelters. 

   Tip Letsche, a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, says more than half the Harvard students her firm interviewed this season participated in the project.

   Safeguard Health Enterprises Inc., Anaheim, Calif., said it believes that a proposal from a group of investors led by a shareholder "doesn't represent a serious attempt to acquire the company and isn't backed by adequate financing." 

   Safeguard said Friday it had been approached about a possible purchase of the company. 
Safeguard said an outside holder "indicated orally" that a group that he represents is "contemplating making an offer of $10 a share to purchase" the company, which had 6.1 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, giving the potential bid an indicated value of $61 million. 
The company said the holder also said that financing had been arranged. 

   The announcement drove Safeguard's shares sharply lower yesterday. 
In national over-the-counter trading, the shares fell 87.5 cents to close at $5.50. 

   The company, which operates prepaid dental plans in 13 states and has been authorized in three others, said it's referring the incident "to the proper authorities for their review."

   Singer Peggy Lee, who co-wrote the lyrics and performed songs and voices for Walt Disney Co.'s cartoon classic "Lady and the Tramp," filed a $25 million lawsuit in state court charging that she hasn't received any money from videocassette sales of the film. 

   In the lawsuit she charged that Disney ignored a 1952 contract provision that barred the company from making "phonograph recordings and or transcriptions for sale to the public" without her consent. 
She argued that the provision applied to videotapes. 
Miss Lee's attorney, Alvin Deutsch, said that Disney maintains that "transcriptions" referred only to sheet music. 
Videocassettes weren't around in 1952. 

   A Disney spokesman said the company hadn't yet been served with the lawsuit and it has no comment. 

   At a New York press conference, Miss Lee said she noticed the contract provision only after she helped Disney promote the videotape version of "Lady and the Tramp," which has sold several million copies. 
She said she received a $500 honorarium for her promotional work, a figure she termed "insulting."

<HL> U.S. Rejects Trade Petition Against Canada --- Denial of Michigan Effort Could Become an Issue In the Canadian Election </HL>

   The White House turned down Michigan Gov. James Blanchard's unfair-trade complaint against Canada for its auto-parts practices, a move that could become an issue in the bitter Canadian election campaign. 

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter denied the petition partly on the grounds that the proposed U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement -- the main issue in Canada's election campaign -- would resolve the dispute. 
He also ruled that, as a political official, the governor has no legal right to file the trade petition. 

   By citing those two reasons for his decision, Mr. Yeutter implied that the U.S. might accept the complaint later if it is refiled by a U.S. industry or union, and if Canadian voters reject Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the trade pact in national elections Monday. 

   In Montreal, where Liberal Leader John Turner is campaigning for Monday's election, an aide to Mr. Turner noted that the trade agreement wasn't in effect because it hadn't been approved by Canada's Parliament. 
As a result, Mr. Yeutter was making "a very generous interpretation of the status" of the agreement, the aide said. 

   Canadian opponents of the trade agreement are likely to attack the decision as an effort to boost the campaign of Mr. Mulroney, who negotiated the treaty, by showing Canadians the pact could ward off nasty trade fights with the U.S. 

   In fact, Reagan administration officials privately said they wished they could have delayed the decision for fear that almost anything they did could be cited as interference in the Canadian campaign. 
But under the timetable imposed by the trade law, they were forced to rule this week. 

   Similarly, the administration is nervous about a routine trade address President Reagan plans to deliver today to a Chamber of Commerce audience. 
The speech is designed largely as a call to the world's nations to make progress in trade negotiations scheduled for next month in Montreal. 
But because it is expected to include a brief and positive reference to the U.S.-Canada trade pact, it already is being portrayed by some in Canada as an effort to aid Mr. Mulroney. 

   White House aides want to do as little as possible to lend credence to the charge by opponents of the treaty that the U.S. is interfering in the vote, so they have labored in recent days to formulate as brief and innocuous a reference to the pact in the speech as they can. 

   In the Michigan complaint, Gov. Blanchard argued that Canada has abused its free access to the U.S. auto market -- granted under a separate pact dating to the 1960s -- to lure auto-parts manufacturers to its side of the border. 
The country gives rebates on import duties to foreign auto-parts firms that agree to use Canada as a base for making parts destined for the U.S. market. 

   Under the proposed trade agreement, Canada has agreed to phase out the practice over 10 years. 
But Michigan, the U.S. auto-parts industry, and the United Auto Workers union all have argued that the proposed phase-out is too slow. 

   If Canada dumps the treaty, Michigan trade officials say the industry or union may renew the trade complaint so that it couldn't be rejected on the grounds of legal standing.

<HL> International: Siemens and Britain's GEC Launch Joint $3.08 Billion Offer for Plessey --- Analysts Bet Bid To Create Powerhouse Will Win, But Board Opposes It ---- This article was prepared by Richard L. Hudson and Barbara Toman in London, And Thomas F. O'Boyle in Bonn </HL>

<TEXT>
   The map of Europe's electronics industry was redrawn yesterday. 

   Two titans of European electronics, No. 1-ranking Siemens AG of West Germany and fourth-ranking General Electric Co. of Britain, stunned industry-watchers with a bid to take over much smaller British rival Plessey Co. 
The #1.7 billion ($3.08 billion) takeover attempt, though opposed by Plessey's board, has a good chance of winning, London analysts said. 

   In one stroke, the takeover would forge an unprecedented alliance in electronics between Britain and West Germany, through their two largest electronics champions. 
GEC, which isn't related to General Electric Co. of the U.S., and Siemens said they plan to run Plessey as an independent, jointly owned division. 
But the move was widely expected to lead to further links between the two companies, and maybe, one day, a full merger. 
The resulting powerhouse would be a new, European force in electronics with business tentacles reaching world-wide. 

   More important, industry pundits said, the Anglo-German alliance opens the final act in the restructuring of Europe's ailing electronics industry. 
For more than three years, a series of mergers and joint ventures have been transforming Europe's telecommunications, semiconductor, computer and electrical engineering industries. 
Of the major European nations, only Britain had failed to ally with anybody. 

   GEC's choice of Siemens as a partner sets the stage for the next task in revitalizing European electronics: scrapping big bureaucracies, duplicative factories and outdated marketing strategies, says Margaret Sharp, a technology-policy analyst at the Science Policy Research Unit of Britain's University of Sussex. 
These handicaps make Europe run a distant third to Japan and the U.S. in the world electronics market. 

   "The restructuring {through mergers} was a necessary thing to do" for European electronics to have a fighting chance, Ms. Sharp says. 
"But there's still a question" whether they can improve their competitiveness." 

   For U.S. and Japanese companies eager to boost their European presence, the GEC-Siemens bid suggests there is little time left to find a significant European partner. 
After 1992, when the European Community's internal trade barriers are scheduled to fall and its external protectionism may rise, a European partner may be necessary. 
Sensing this, non-Europeans likely will redouble overtures to the few remaining, unallied EC electronics companies such as Italy's state-owned telephone-exchange maker, Italtel S.p.A. 

   The prospect of 1992 also spurred GEC and Siemens to act. 
In a joint statement, the two companies said their Plessey bid would be the "springboard for further substantial expansion" to meet the challenges of the post-1992 EC market. 

   Siemens officials at Munich headquarters were unavailable for comment yesterday, a German holiday. 
GEC officials in London declined to comment directly to U.S. journalists, citing concern about U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, even though their bid isn't being made in the U.S., where Plessey has a small number of American Depositary Receipts registered. 

   Plessey declined to comment, except to say it "emphatically rejects" the Siemens-GEC bid. 

   Many financial analysts, who long have thought GEC and Siemens represented inefficiency in European electronics, cheered the bid. 

   Both companies are sprawling, integrated-electronics behemoths, that make everything from semiconductors, computers and telephone switches to military radar and kitchen appliances. 
Both have big bureaucracies and cozy relations with their respective governments. 
Both companies have been trying new strategies to regain momentum. 

   Until recently, both were criticized as timid deal-makers. 
GEC had #1.38 billion in cash as of March 31, the end of its fiscal year; its net income in the period was #445 million on revenue of #5.55 billion. 
Siemens' reported cash hoard was 10.3 billion marks ($5.92 billion) as of Sept. 30, 1987, the end of its most recently reported fiscal year. 
Its net income was 1.3 billion marks on revenue of 51.5 billion marks. 

   Smaller, scrappier Plessey is engaged in a wrenching reorganization. 

   Plessey has had to struggle for domestic British business in GEC's shadow. 
Plessey's profit plunged in 1985 and 1986. 
In 1985, GEC made another bid for Plessey, which was unsuccessful. 
At government prodding, Plessey later merged its telecommunications business into a 50-50 venture with GEC. Last year, Plessey began buying smaller U.S. and British semiconductor and defense electronics concerns. 

   But it just hasn't been enough, many London financial analysts say. 
"The prospects for {Plessey} as an independent company look to be difficult," says Richard Ryder, a London-based analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. 
In the year ended March 31, Plessey had net income of #131.1 million on revenue of #1.3 billion. 

   GEC and Siemens said they plan to offer 225 pence for every Plessey share. 
On London's stock exchange yesterday, Plessey shares soared 55 pence ($1) each on the news, to 230.5 pence, then fell back slightly to 224 pence. 

   GEC and Siemens said they formed a 50-50 venture to make the bid which calls for Plessey to continue operating as an independent company in Europe. 
In North America, GEC would control 51% of Plessey's defense electronics businesses. 
In telecommunications, GEC would take a 60% stake to Siemens's 40%. 

   GEC also plans to buy a 50% stake in Siemens's defense electronics business, which has annual sales of about #250 million. 

   Analysts expect Plessey to fight hard for its survival. 
Although the government blocked GEC's previous bid as anti-competitive, London analysts expect the government to acquiesce now, though possibly after a monopolies probe.

<TEXT>
   One of the world's biggest radiotelescopes collapsed in what an astronomer lamented as a "major blow" to science. 

   The 26-year-old instrument, an antenna dish the size of a football field in diameter, gave way late Tuesday, according to George Seielstad, assistant director for Green Bank operations at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. 
The cause of the collapse was under investigation. 

   The 300-foot telescope, a metal latticework bowl resembling a TV satellite dish, was capable of intercepting naturally emitted radio signals from celestial bodies up to 10 billion light years away. 
It was completed in 1962 at a cost of $850,000 and took 18 months to build. 

   Jack Renirie, a National Science Foundation spokesman, said the telescope was funded by the foundation and operated by a consortium of nine universities, including Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins. 

   The observatory, opened in 1959, has eight smaller telescopes, the smallest 40 feet in diameter. 
Green Bank is about 100 miles east of Charleston in the Monongahela National Forest.

<HL> Commodities: Copper Futures Prices End Moderately Lower, After a Late Recovery Trims Early Declines </HL>

   Copper futures prices ended moderately lower, after a late recovery trimmed early declines. 

   The December-delivery metal ended at $1.28 a pound, for a loss of 1.90 cents. 
At one point, the December contract showed a loss of 4.15 cents. 

   Demand from commodity funds that follow computer-generated signals provided most of the late support, according to William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. 
The funds were thought to be the buying back of contracts that had been sold short. 

   Peruvian miners, who are on strike, expect their case to go to the Peruvian Supreme Court in a week or 10 days, according to Mr. O'Neill. 

   The head of the mining federation, Alfredo Silva, said he believed the Supreme Court was likely to reaffirm a lower court ruling that the government had to negotiate with the federation on a nationwide basis and not mine by mine, which would be a violation of the miners' collective bargaining rights, Mr. O'Neill said. 

   Mr. Silva also said he didn't expect the government to appeal such a verdict, according to Mr. O'Neill. 

   "This is creating a face-saving type of situation in which the government could claim it has to negotiate with the miners and could serve as a vehicle to start the talks," Mr. O'Neill said. 

   Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, had a more mixed picture of the developments in Peru. 

   "One union leader said he expected the strike to end in week or two and that the miners would get what they're asking for," said Ms. Raptopoulos. 
Others in Peru thought the strike would end even sooner, she said. 

   "On the other hand, there were also reports that miners had marched on the Ministry of Labor in Lima and an estimated 300 of them had thrown rocks at the ministry and demanded the minister's resignation," she said. 

   Ms. Raptopoulos added that 20 miners had been arrested and that 80 others are going on a hunger strike beginning today. 

   "I suspect that the strike will end in a week or two because of the significant loss of revenue the country is experiencing from the strike and the loss of income to the miners," Ms. Raptopoulos said. 

   In other commodity markets yesterday:
   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed as gold, silver and platinum each moved in its own direction. 
December gold was unchanged at $425.60 an ounce. 
December silver declined 9.3 cents an ounce at $6.30. 
January platinum rose $2.20 an ounce to $580.40. 
Precious metals appeared to ignore the improvement in the trade deficit in September, and in particular the inflationary implications of record exports, an analyst said. 
Weakness in oil and the dollar also were depressing factors but the main reason for a lack of direction in precious metals is the slowdown in demand for gold bullion, particularly in the Far East, he said. 

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices eased. 
The November-delivery contract ended 2.70 cents a pound lower at $1.7960. 
Concern about tight supplies of the concentrate that provided support for the market this year should be alleviated in 1989 by increased Florida output and flat demand, said Judy Ganes, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. 
U.S. consumption has leveled off because of high prices, although there has been increased competition at the retail level, she said. 
In Europe, she added, importers overbought when there was increasing concern about supplies and now are well-inventoried for the near future, at least, according to Ms. Ganes. 

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices eased. The December delivery was off 23 cents a barrel to $13.67. The softer tone was attributed to a news wire report that said members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are producing crude oil at the rate of 22.5 million barrels a day, an analyst said. This is a 10-year high and well above the official OPEC quota of 16.5 million barrels. It is also above estimated world demand of 19 million barrels a day, he said. The Indonesian oil minister was reported as saying that Iran said it would agree for Iraq to have a production quota equal to that of Iran's, the analyst said. Iraq doesn't have a quota currently, but Iran's quota is 2.6 million barrels a day and it is said to be producing at the rate of 2.7 million barrels daily. Traders were focusing on talks by OPEC price and strategy committees that are to begin today in Vienna. These are preliminary talks at which such matters as production cuts, quotas and prices will be dealt with before being fully discussed by all OPEC members Monday in Vienna. -
   STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices fell sharply on continued weakness in the dollar and lower bond futures prices. 
Comments in Washington from Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, that the U.S. can't "grow" its way out of the budget deficit also pushed financial markets lower, traders said. 
An exception were most foreign currency futures, which rose sharply in price in reaction to the lower dollar. 
"Money managers are saying that with the dollar below 123 yen U.S. stocks have little value to foreign owners," said Gerald Walsh, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in New York. 
At midafternoon the dollar was quoted at 122.45 Japanese yen in New York cash market trading. 
Falling bond futures prices near their close of trading at 3 p.m. EST quashed a rally attempt in stocks and stock futures. 
The December Treasury bond futures contract fell 13/16 to close at 88 5/32. 
Traders said that the 88 1/2 level was an important technical support level for bond futures. 
Once that level was breached, traders following such technical guidelines sold futures contracts that they had purchased at higher prices to avoid further losses. 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures for settlement in December fell 4.45 to close at 265.05.

   U.S. businesses plan to increase capital spending 5.3% in 1989 after an 11% increase this year, according to a new survey. 

   The survey shows that the manufacturing sector plans to boost capital spending 6.3% next year. 
The nondurable-goods segment anticipates a 6.7% rise in outlays, led by strong expansion plans in the paper and chemicals industries. 
Durable-goods manufacturers, led by steel and machinery, are planning a 5.8% increase in capital spending. 

   By contrast, the nonmanufacturing segment anticipates a 4.6% increase in capital outlays in 1989. 
Growth in the commercial and mining industries will be offset by weakness in the electric-utility sector. 

   The survey was conducted by Economic Consulting &amp; Planning Inc., the successor firm to Merrill Lynch Economic Consulting Group and Lionel D. Edie &amp; Co.

<HL> Dollar's Drop Hammers Stock and Bond Prices --- Wednesday's Markets: Industrials Fall 38.59; Bonds Decline a Point </HL>

   The dollar plunged yesterday afternoon, forcing stocks and bonds into sharp declines. 

   Stocks also were hurt by other factors, including a major retreat by takeover-stock speculators and apparently unfounded rumors that Japanese investors were heavily selling stock-index futures. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 38.59 points to finish at 2038.58, its lowest level since Sept. 1. 
The industrials were off more than 47 points just before the close. 
Government bond prices were hammered down about a point, or about $10 for each $1,000 face amount. 

   The dollar, which had seemed to stabilize in early trading, fell sharply in the afternoon, particularly against the mark. 
In late New York foreign exchange trading, the U.S. currency was down about one yen against the Japanese unit and a whopping three pfennig against the West German currency. 

   In midmorning, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, hinted that the Fed may be forced to push interest rates higher if large federal budget deficits persist. 
His remarks raised fears of accelerating inflation and higher interest rates, though Fed purchases of dollars held the dollar to narrow losses until the afternoon. 

   "Greenspan was definitely the catalyst for the downturn" in the financial markets, said Jeff Applegate, an analyst at Tucker, Anthony &amp; R.L. Day in New York. 

   The much-anticipated report on the trade deficit for September turned out to be a non-event. 
The deficit figure came in at $10.5 billion, down from $12.18 billion in August and in line with expectations. 
Analysts said the drop wasn't enough to counteract the negative influences in the markets. 

   The bad news for stocks started a little after 8:30 a.m. EST, when a powerful investment group announced it would not even enter a bid in the $20 billion-plus competition to acquire RJR Nabisco Corp. in a leveraged buy-out. 

   After an imbalance of sell orders delayed the opening in RJR stock for 25 minutes, it started trading at 86 5/8, down 1 7/8 from Tuesday's close. 
It sagged further as more and more takeover speculators sold shares to raise cash to cover losses. 

   In the early afternoon, news that Arizona health authorities have asked RJR to remove its new "smokeless" cigarettes from test-marketing in that state exacerbated the selling. 
RJR finished at 84 1/8, down 4 3/8, on volume of more than five million shares, making it yesterday's most actively traded stock. 

   The takeover-stock speculators didn't restrict their selling to RJR. Almost all the actual or rumored deal stocks were weakened in the selling spree. 
The retreat was especially ominous because it has been takeover speculation that has driven stock market buying for months. 

   Meanwhile, beginning at about 11 a.m. EST, rumors began circulating that Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. traders were selling a huge order of futures contracts on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index in the pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
According to the rumors, Dean Witter was acting for a big Japanese securities client, the U.S. unit of Yamaichi Securities Co. 
"We're hearing they're dumping 2,000 contracts at a crack {a very large order by post-crash standards}," said a stock trader at one New York-based investment pool. 

   But Yamaichi denied the rumors. 
"This makes a dozen calls I've had on this today," said an annoyed trading official at Yamaichi's New York-based U.S. subsidiary. 
He acknowledged that the firm actively sold S&amp;P 500 futures last week, and that Dean Witter handled some of the sales. 
But he added that "we haven't been a heavy seller at all this week." 

   Neither futures trading officials nor a spokesman for Dean Witter could be reached for comment. 

   The triple whammy of bad news -- takeover-stock selling, the Yamaichi/Dean Witter rumor and the dollar's worsening fall -- sent institutional investors and other professional traders to the sidelines as the afternoon wore on. 
As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 17 points at 1:45 p.m. EST, skidded some 27 points further before rebounding a bit just before the close. 

   The over-the-counter market was also bruised. 
The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.34 points to 367.79, the lowest level in nearly six months. 

   raders said the Fed's currency market midmorning intervention on behalf of the dollar was modest and thus had little effect. 
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted only slightly above its post-World War II low of 120.25 yen, which it hit Dec. 31, 1987. 

   In the credit markets, Treasury bonds had their biggest setback since Nov. 4, as investors reacted to the prospect of foreign bond buyers pulling back because of the weaker dollar. 
Foreign investors, especially Japanese institutions, for years have purchased huge amounts of long-term Treasury issues, and their buying is now considered necessary to the health of the government bond market. 

   In summary, yesterday:
   Stocks fell broadly. 
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange far outpaced gainers 1,237 to 316. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 38.59-point fall amounted to 1.86%. 
Big Board volume of 161.7 million shares compared to an unusually weak turnover of 115.2 million Tuesday. 

   Treasury bonds' fall also accelerated in the afternoon. 
The government's benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds dropped from a decline of only about 3/8 of a point in the early afternoon to end the day about a point lower. 
The issue's yield, which moves opposite to prices, rose to about 9.10%, the highest since late September and up from about 9.01% Tuesday. 

   The dollar plunged. 
In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7166 marks and 122.23 yen, compared with 1.7428 marks and 123.23 yen late Tuesday.

<HL> Regulators Charge Guards Slept on Job At Nuclear Plant </HL>

   Federal regulators said security guards were found sleeping while on duty last summer at Philadelphia Electric Co.'s troubled Peach Bottom nuclear plant and proposed fining the company $50,000. 

   The staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also discovered other problems with the security staff. 
The agency said watchmen and guards weren't properly posted at security areas left open for access and that an unauthorized person had a key to a security area. 

   In four instances in July and August, the agency said security guards were found "sleeping or otherwise inattentive to duty." 
It is the second time that Peach Bottom workers have been found sleeping on the job. 
In March 1987, the NRC ordered Peach Bottom closed after reactor operators were found napping at the controls. 
In that incident, other control-room employees were playing video games. 
The plant has yet to resume operations. 

   For nearly two years, Philadelphia Electric has been wracked by attitude problems at Peach Bottom, located on the Susquehanna River about 45 miles downstream from Three Mile Island. 
A number of plant workers have been dismissed for distributing drugs on the job. 

   Troubles at the facility have cost Philadelphia Electric about $116 million in replacement power costs, a rate reduction connected to the closure, and expenses for retraining control-room operators. 
The problems also prompted the departures of James Lee Everett III, Philadelphia Electric's former chairman, and John H. Austin Jr., its former president, last spring. 

   The security violations aren't expected to push back efforts to restart the plant. 
The company hopes Peach Bottom will be ready to resume operations in the second quarter of 1989. 

   Philadelphia Electric said it discovered the security guard problems at Peach Bottom in July and August, and that it has since hired a new security contractor. 
However, the NRC said security troubles were first discovered in June 1987 after an agency inspection. 
What's more, the NRC has met with management three times since last February to discuss security violations. 

   Philadelphia Electric has 30 days to pay the fine or contest it. 
Because the company reported the violations to the NRC, the agency said it reduced the proposed penalty to $50,000 from $100,000. 

   The utility said it is reviewing the NRC report but that no decision has been made about contesting the proposed fine. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Philadelphia Electric closed at $19.50, down 12.5 cents.

<HL> Technology: Low Levels of 'Good' Cholesterol May Pose Heart Risk, Studies Say </HL>
<AUTHOR> Michael Waldholz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> WLA </CO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   New research indicates that some people with "safe" blood cholesterol levels may still run a high risk of heart disease, a finding that may overturn cholesterol guidelines released just last year. 

   Four new studies strongly suggest that heart disease can strike individuals with especially low amounts of high-density lipoproteins, or HDL -- the body's so-called good cholesterol -- even if their total cholesterol level is below 200 milligrams per deciliter, an amount doctors currently think is safe. 

   The studies, presented in Washington, D.C., at the annual American Heart Association meeting, may force doctors to take HDL levels more seriously and encourage them to screen patients commonly for HDL, as well as for total cholesterol. 

   While having high levels of HDL was widely thought to provide a protection against heart attacks, the new studies are the first to show that low levels of HDL can be very dangerous. 

   The reports may fuel the already surprisingly strong sales performance of Warner-Lambert Co.'s cholesterol drug, Lopid, which is particularly effective in raising HDL levels. 
Lopid has been available for six years. 
But its sales growth was sluggish until late last year when a Finnish study indicated that Lopid can reduce the risk of heart attacks. 
That study provided the first strong evidence of the importance of raising HDL. Analysts expect Lopid sales to double to about $200 million this year. 

   In one study, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore looked at patients who had clogged arteries even though their cholesterol levels were below 200. 
In the study, 68% of 138 men and 32% of 37 women had HDL levels of less than 35. 
HDL amounts above that level are considered safe and levels of 60 to 80 are considered protective. 

   Another study by researchers at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston found that 60% of individuals with cholesterol below 200 had signs of clogged arteries. 
About three-quarters of those with disease had HDL below 40. 

   Also, a report by doctors at Boston University School of Medicine found that patients with total cholesterol below 240 run a three-times-greater risk of heart disease than those with levels above 240 if their HDL is below the safety range. 

   A report based on a study of 22,071 individuals in a program called the Physicians' Health Study found that those with the lowest HDL levels had five times the risk of heart disease as those with high HDL. 

   HDL's job in the bloodstream is to scavenge potentially dangerous cholesterol out of the body. 
High total cholesterol is believed to promote artery clogging, a condition that can cause heart disease. 

   The new studies seem to indicate that if the HDL is too low, even low levels of cholesterol can become dangerous. 
High HDL is common in people who exercise often and have low-fat diets, but it may also be associated with genetic factors. 

   Current guidelines to doctors issued last year by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recommended that people check their HDL only if their total cholesterol rises above 240. 
The new reports will probably trigger a debate to change the guidelines. 
But some doctors at the heart meeting argued that more data are needed first, while others contended that several other lipoproteins may be equally important, and that they, too, should be regularly screened.

<HL> Chairmen's Conversation May Indicate Pillsbury, Grand Met Are Set to Talk </HL>

<TEXT>
   The chairmen of Pillsbury Co. and Grand Metropolitan PLC talked Tuesday for the first time since Grand Met made its hostile tender offer, but the two couldn't agree on a face-to-face meeting. 

   Despite the apparent impasse, their brief trans-Atlantic phone conversation spurred a belief on Wall Street that negotiations at last may be in the offing. 
And, according to Grand Met, its chairman indicated that while he saw no reason to sweeten the $60-a-share tender offer, he was prepared to listen to arguments as to why that amount should be increased. 

   Meanwhile, a Delaware Chancery Court judge said he would hear arguments Nov. 28 on whether Pillsbury's proposed spinoff of its Burger King Corp. unit should be delayed. 
Chancellor William T. Allen also said he would review Dec. 12 an earlier court ruling upholding Pillsbury's poison pill defense and issue a decision on it by Dec. 16. 
Since that would be two weeks after the scheduled spinoff date, the news was seen as a victory for Grand Met in what's become a protracted legal war. 

   Grand Met said it would file a motion with the court today seeking to temporarily restrain Pillsbury from proceeding with the spinoff, which Grand Met has characterized as a "poison tax" to frustrate its $5.23 billion takeover bid. 

   On Wall Street, Pillsbury stock fell $2, to close at $56, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
A report that Grand Met threatened to reduce its tender offer if the spinoff occurred was believed responsible for the slippage. 
News of the contact between the two chairmen came shortly before the market closed. 

   While the two companies had slightly differing versions of the conversation and events surrounding it, both agreed Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith promised to relay what transpired to his board. 

   Grand Met said that its chairman and chief executive officer, Allen Sheppard, pressed for a meeting with Mr. Smith in New York today or tomorrow but that Mr. Smith initially said he wasn't authorized to attend such a meeting. 
Mr. Sheppard then reportedly told Mr. Smith he "was prepared to listen to any arguments Mr. Smith might have as to why Grand Met ought to pay more than $60 a share." 

   Pillsbury's version said Mr. Smith indicated he doubted there was anything to discuss because the Pillsbury board has repeatedly termed the bid inadequate. 

   The interchange between Messrs. 
Sheppard and Smith began with a letter Grand Met telefaxed to Pillsbury. 
In it, Mr. Sheppard suggested the New York meeting this week and said he would phone Mr. Smith within the hour to discuss it. 
In that call, Mr. Sheppard said he understood Mr. Smith was authorized to explore all alternatives for Pillsbury "and surely Grand Met's offer must be one of those alternatives," according to Grand Met's account. 
Mr. Smith then asked specifically what Mr. Sheppard wished to discuss. 

   Yesterday Mr. Sheppard sent another letter to Mr. Smith saying he was looking forward to hearing from Mr. Smith after the Pillsbury chairman had reported back to his board, Grand Met said. 

   Pillsbury's version was tinged with coolness. 
It said that Mr. Sheppard "merely reiterated his desire to meet" and that Mr. Smith "saw no purpose in meeting." 
Nevertheless, Mr. Smith agreed to report the conversation to his directors. 

   Complicating the rapidly unfolding scenario were unconfirmed reports that Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc., had talked with Pillsbury advisers about somehow teaming up with the Minneapolis food and restaurants concern to make a bid for Grand Met, a move known as the Pac-Man defense. 

   Pillsbury seemed willing to let the reports go undenied as they cast some doubt on Grand Met's plans. 
They also contributed to a slight rise in Grand Met stock, which closed at 447 pence, up nine pence, in London Stock Exchange trading. 
Aides to Mr. Perelman didn't return calls.

   Despite the announcement of U.S. September trade data that were well within market expectations and U.S. central-bank intervention, the dollar fell sharply. 

   The September deficit was announced at a seasonally adjusted $10.46 billion, compared with $12.27 billion for August. 
Market expectations ranged from a deficit of $9.5 billion to $11 billion. 
A survey of economists by Dow Jones predicted a deficit of $10.5 billion. 

   Bearish dollar sentiment was reinforced by comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told the National Economic Commission in Washington that the continuation of capital flows at current levels into the U.S. may be "questionable." 

   He said historical evidence indicated "sizable foreign net capital inflows have not persisted, and hence may not be a reliable substitute for domestic savings on a long term basis." 

   With the dollar losing a yen, it is rapidly approaching its post World War II low of 121 yen, set Dec. 31. 
In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 122.23 yen, down from 123.23 yen late Tuesday, and at 1.7166 marks, down from 1.7428 marks. 
The pound traded at $1.8330, up from $1.8088. 

   In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 122.40 yen, down sharply from Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen. 
It was the U.S. currency's lowest opening level since Jan. 4, the year's first trading day, when it opened at 120.45 yen. 

   Explaining why the market sold the dollar heavily Wednesday, Richard Witten, vice president, foreign exchange, at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said that assuming the trade numbers were neutral for the market, "then you go back to what were the market's expectations before the 48-hour period when it was fixated on the trade figures." 
Sentiment then was bearish, or for a weaker dollar. 

   "Once the trade numbers were out of the way, one was left with the concern in the market place that the U.S. won't be able to deal with its fiscal issues," he said, which restored the dollar's bearishness. 

   "Overall, the events of today have to be analyzed as a market looking for further reasons to sell the dollar," said Dennis Pettit, vice president with Banque Paribas. 
"The market is definitely getting itself wound up to trash the dollar." 

   But Lars Pedersen, chief international economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, saw reasons to be optimistic regarding the trade numbers and said the markets may not be paying enough attention to the details of the trade figures. 

   "The trade data are showing consistent export expansion in manufactured goods," Mr. Pedersen said. 
"And the bulk of the import expansion has been in capital goods which could set the stage for increased capacity within the economy." 

   Although Mr. Greenspan's comments were regarded as negative for the dollar because he indicated reduced demand for dollar-based assets, other monetary officials in the U.S. and Japan continued to express support for the U.S. currency in an effort to stabilize the market. 

   But their efforts provided minimal support as did Fed intervention when it bought dollars in the open market at 123.00 yen during early New York trading. 

   When the dollar resumed its slide soon after the intervention and the Fed failed to provide continued, immediate support, traders concluded the operation was designed to smooth the slide rather than to give the U.S. currency support. 

   The Fed re-entered the market late in New York trading, buying dollars at the 122.25 yen level. 
The intervention provided only limited support for the dollar. 

   Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said a further drop in the value of the dollar isn't "particularly useful." 
Fed Gov. Wayne Angell said the dollar was within an appropriate trading range. 
Mr. Angell also characterized previous comments by Martin Feldstein that the dollar should decline to 100 yen as "somewhat irresponsible." 
Mr. Feldstein is a Harvard economist and past adviser to President-elect Bush. 

   Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita reiterated comments that the Japanese central bank stands ready to intervene in the foreign-exchange market when necessary to maintain stability. 

   With so many officials making almost daily public statements in support of the dollar, dealers are beginning to question the effectiveness of the verbal barrage. 

   "The market has found out several times that talk is cheap," said Marc Cohen, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange with Republic National Bank. 

   Referring to Mr. Johnson's comments, Mr. Cohen added: "If there had been less of an underlying negative tone to the market, then we could have gone 50 or 60 points higher on these comments. 
Instead, we went 15 points higher and just sat there. . . . 
When they {central banks} come into the market in concert, then that will be the signal that the dollar has fallen far enough." 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold rose 10 cents to settle at $424.50 an ounce in heavy trading. 
Estimated volume was five million ounces. 

   In trading in Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $424.30 an ounce.

   International Multifoods Corp. said it bought back for $53.8 million the nearly 12% of its common shares held by a Toronto-based investors group. 

   The Minneapolis food company said it paid Bregman Partners and its affiliates $30.75 a share for the group's 1,751,000 shares. 
That's 25 cents a share less than Tuesday's closing price for Multifoods stock. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Multifoods shares fell 37.5 cents to $30.625 in heavy trading. 

   A spokeswoman said the company decided to buy the shares after the group told Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. it was interested in selling its stake. 
The spokeswoman said battling the investor group over various issues was costly for the company, and the company decided it was in "the best interests of shareholders" to buy the stake. 

   In July, Bregman Partners proposed a restructuring of the Minneapolis food company. 
Bregman Partners represents the Bregman family of Toronto and the Belzberg family of Vancouver, British Columbia.

   A Pillsbury spokesman indicated Mr. Pillsbury had declared a "hands-off" policy on any transactions involving company shares. 
Nevertheless, the disclosure is embarrassing, given the company's urgings that holders retain their shares and not tender to Grand Metropolitan PLC. 

   While Mr. Pillsbury runs a Minneapolis investment concern that handles trusts for various clients, it is believed that several of the trust transactions involve Pillsbury family members. 

   Mr. Pillsbury didn't return repeated telephone requests for comment. 

   In one transaction reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, trusts of which Mr. Pillsbury is a trustee but has no beneficial interest sold 34,630 shares. 
The trusts weren't identified. 
The open-market transaction, completed Oct. 25 at $59.58 a share, totaled nearly $2.1 million.

   Renewed weakness in the dollar, coupled with worries about the outlook for interest rates, sent stock prices plunging in moderate trading. 

   The long-awaited September U.S. trade report was largely overlooked as prices began their slide just after the opening bell in response to the dollar's decline. 
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 38.59 at 2038.58, its lowest level in 2 1/2 months. 

   Blue-chip issues had outperformed the broader market Tuesday, but no such difference was apparent this time. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.52 to 263.82, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 4.22 to 248.19, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 2.37 to 148.96. 
More than 1,237 Big Board issues declined in price, and only about 316 advanced. 

   The trade data proved to be a non-event for the market, as the narrowing of the deficit to $10.46 billion in September from $12.27 billion in August was right in line with most forecasts. 
One consensus estimate had put the September figure at $10.5 billion. 

   As a result, attention quickly shifted to the falling dollar, which sent stocks skidding through midday. 
The market attempted to rebound in early afternoon trading, but the move fizzled as buyers proved scarce, and prices dropped to session lows just before the close. 

   Trading activity picked up substantially from Tuesday's unusually slow pace. 
Volume on the Big Board was 161,710,000 shares, the highest since Oct. 27, compared with 115,170,000 Tuesday. 

   Traders said statements by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan created some concern in the market. 
Mr. Greenspan said, among other things, that the Fed will be forced to maintain a relatively tight monetary policy if wide federal budget deficits persist. 

   His remarks came amid growing expectations that short-term interest rates, already widely viewed as high enough to hurt stocks, are headed even higher. 
Analysts suggested that a prime-rate increase by major banks could occur soon if the central bank gives any indication that it is tightening credit. 

   Although some analysts say technical features of the market suggest that stock prices could soon bounce back, they also point out that the upward trend stocks have seen since the October 1987 market crash is in danger of being broken. 
"That's why you're seeing such selling pressure on stocks where there's been no fundamental change," said Edward P. Nicoski, a market analyst at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc., Minneapolis. 

   Noting that the market's momentum in its rallies over the past several months has been getting progressively weaker and that fewer issues have taken part in each upward move, Mr. Nicoski said the latest downturn "might be the straw which broke the camel's back." 

   Without a turnaround by the dollar and the bond market -- which has slumped in response to the weakness in the U.S. currency -- he said, any attempt the market may make to break out of its downward spiral can't be expected to succeed. 

   "There just isn't anything out there that the investment community really likes," Mr. Nicoski said. 
"People don't know what's going on, they don't want to make decisions, and cash seems to be king here." 

   Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment policy analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said she holds some hope for a rebound in stocks because of her view that the U.S. economy should keep expanding at a modest pace even though rates have risen. 

   "What we're seeing is a coming to terms with the reality of the situation" regarding the budget deficit and other issues for which some of the market apparently had hoped quick solutions would be found, Ms. Cohen said. 
"Nothing has changed in the past few weeks in regard to the economy." 

   RJR Nabisco, the most active Big Board issue, on composite volume of five million shares, tumbled 4 1/2 to 84 after a group consisting of Forstmann Little and three other consumer-products companies abandoned its plan to submit a takeover offer. 
The three were Procter &amp; Gamble, which dropped 7/8 to 79 1/4; Ralston Purina, which went down 5/8 to 76; and Castle &amp; Cooke, which eased 3/4 to 25. 

   Among other takeover-related stocks:
   --Plessey soared 8 5/8 to 40 3/8. 
Britain's General Electric and West Germany's Siemens launched a joint acquisition offer valued at more than $3 billion. 

   --Interco lost 1 7/8 to 63 3/8 amid indications that a group headed by the Rales brothers of Washington would end its $74-a-share tender offer without buying any shares. 

   --Pillsbury fell 2 to 56 as investors responded to Grand Metropolitan's threat to lower its offer of $60 a share if the company carries out a planned spinoff of its Burger King unit. 

   --Prime Computer dropped 3/4 to 17. 
The company urged holders not to take any action on a $20-a-share offer by MAI Basic Four, controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow. 
Separately, MAI said it obtained part of the financing for its bid. 

   Elsewhere, International Multifoods fell 3/8 to 30 5/8. 
The company bought back a block of 1,750,000 common shares, a 12% stake, for $30.75 a share from Bregman Partners, a group including Canada's Belzberg family. 
The group had said six months ago that it might seek control. 

   Springs Industries gained 1 3/4 to 29 1/4. 
The Close family, which founded the company and holds a majority stake, postponed a planned sale of two million common shares. 

   BankAmerica closed at 17 3/4 unchanged, in active trading amid growing expectations that it will reinstate its dividend on its common early next year. 
A source at the company told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it would be "very logical" to conclude that BankAmerica could afford to resume the payout at that time. 

   The American Stock Exchange index slid 3.29 to 286.30. 
Volume was 8,040,000 shares, compared with 8,280,000 Tuesday. 
There were 137 issues advancing, 438 declining and 281 unchanged. 

   Ionics rose 1/2 to 16 1/8. 
The company said it received a sweetened acquisition offer from Cenith Partners of $20 a share. 
Ionics rejected Cenith's proposal for a negotiated transaction at $17 a share in cash and $8 a share in subordinated debentures. 

   Organogenesis fell 1 3/8 to 14 5/8 before trading was halted because of an order imbalance. 
A company filing showed that contract revenue for the quarter was about half of the year-earlier level. 
The company said the drop was due to a one-time contract payment by Eli Lilly last year. 

   Vulcan surged 1 3/8 to 21 1/4. 
The company said its board declared a special dividend of one share of Eagle-Picher Industries common for every three Vulcan shares. 
The special dividend, which has a current value of about $5.33 for each Vulcan share, will be in lieu of the regular quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share. 

   R.G. Barry rose 5/8 to 5 3/8. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that four insiders at the company have recently been buying its shares. 

   MacNeal-Schwendler dropped 1 3/8 to 9 7/8. 
The company posted third-quarter net income of 16 cents a share, compared with 20 cents a share a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   For her latest movie, "A Cry in the Dark," Meryl Streep's head has been helmeted into a dark Buster Brown hairdo. 
This blunt cut gives her the wary look of a punt returner facing the unfriendly heavyweights waiting to tackle. 

   At first it's off-putting; you think, there she goes again, acting with her hair. 
But as this unsettling picture progresses, you realize that the look is deliberately off-putting. 
You are supposed to see Ms. Streep's character, Lindy Chamberlain, as the world saw her -- cold and remote, peering out from that protective headgear. 
And even more effectively than usual, Ms. Streep disappears into that cool character speaking with an impeccably rough-hewn Down Under accent. 

   The real Lindy Chamberlain became a tabloid queen in 1980, when she took a vacation in the Australian outback with her husband, a minister, and their three children. 
One evening as the family prepared its campsite, their youngest child, a nine-week-old girl, disappeared. 
Though no one saw who took her, the family believed it was a dingo, the bushy-tailed Australian cousin of the American coyote. 
The story was played as a tragedy for a while. 
But the Chamberlains, who didn't have media advisers, watched their lives spin out of control. 
They became the objects of rumors and suspicions that Lindy had murdered their daughter and that her husband, Michael, had covered up for her. 

   The case became an Australian "cause celebre." 
Public opinion moved against the Chamberlains because they were Seventh-Day Adventists and because they seemed to enjoy the publicity they were getting -- and later because Lindy, with her stoniness and snarls, wasn't publicity-conscious enough. 
Despite the scant evidence and absence of motive, she was convicted of murder, at which point the journalistic community began to feel some sympathy for her. 
In 1985, John Bryson wrote about the case in "Evil Angels," the book that became the foundation for the movie. 

   "Cry in the Dark" has a distracted quality, as though director Fred Schepisi, who was born and raised in Australia, wants to keep his characters at a distance, the way they might seem on the evening news. 
He doesn't bow to the conventions of dramatic build, and for the most part gives little sense of time passing or what his characters are thinking or feeling. 
Yet the picture's power draws from this deliberate distancing; the movie isn't about Lindy Chamberlain so much as it is about the way the facts become obscured by imagery and by rumor, which feed a collective mythology. 

   Mr. Schepisi's strategy -- he co-authored the script with Robert Caswell -- is to quickly dispense with the question of Lindy's innocence. 
The opening sequence makes the film maker's position clear. 
Lindy may have made a mistake by failing to zip her baby into the tent, but she didn't -- as was later suggested -- cut the baby's head off and then, coolly, join her family for a campfire cookout. 
The film matter-of-factly lays out the horrible nighttime hunt for the child and the cruel, mundane details of the day after; for example, the district nurse supplies Lindy, who was still nursing the baby, with a breast pump and a diuretic to dry up her milk. 

   Thus, as the rest of the film unfolds, the audience is made to feel the way Michael Dukakis's closest friends must have felt as they watched their man keep repeating his mistakes on camera as though he'd never taken a look at himself on videotape. 
The audience is put in the position of believing in Lindy, and watching her do everything exactly wrong, from a P.R. perspective. 
Her sound bites on the evening news show a woman wearing a mask. 
"You could crack walnuts on her face," someone mutters. (She does look a little witchy when a detractor spits at her in a phone booth and she starts laughing. 
It's probably a neurotic reaction but it looks bad. 
She even looks out-of-place in her own family: Her husband and kids are towheads while her mop is dark.) 
The film observes that people don't like to watch a mother speak about her murdered child dispassionately, though such behavior might be called stoicism in a man. 

   Mr. Schepisi's body of work keeps returning to his fascination with myth and with the chaos that inevitably follows when civilization intrudes on nature. 
In "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith," he told the story of an aborigine half-caste who vents his frustration by murdering whites; "Iceman" was about a primitive exploited by scientists. 
The director has brought a supernatural sensibility to the Western genre ("Barbarosa") and to romantic comedy ("Roxanne"). 

   Here, he and his longtime collaborator, cinematographer Ian Baker, have visually split the film. 
The sequences shot in the outback are resonant and sweeping, full of portent. 
The film makers return again and again to Ayer's Rock, the sacred aboriginal site that has become Australia's biggest tourist attraction. 
It was at this strange place -- the mountainous "rock" looks like a huge clump of red dirt that somebody tossed in the desert among the scrub brush -- that the Chamberlain's baby, Azaria, disappeared. 
The camera zooms in on Ayer's Rock with such speed it seems as though the rock is exerting a centripetal force. 
It's as though the film makers are saying: "Maybe we shouldn't tramp all over nature's preserve. 
Bad things will happen." 

   When the action turns to the humans, the colors wash out and the action slows down. 
The civilized world seems faded and remote -- as though the whole thing were being watched on TV monitors with bad reception. 

   Throughout the picture, Mr. Schepisi has set up a rotating chorus of kibitzers. 
He lays out the distortions and wild rumors by planting clumps of people in bars, at restaurants, at dockside, all of them talking about the Chamberlain case. 
The methodology is a little clunky; it's actually quite rare to see rooms of reporters sit goggle-eyed in front of TV sets and trade judgment calls, the way they do over and over again in this movie. 

   Still, it's a way to efficiently convey information to the audience. 
So we learn that people thought that Azaria, the child's name, meant "sacrifice in the wilderness" and believed that Seventh-Day Adventists were some weird cult that periodically killed babies. 
The gossip also reveals a strange nationalistic support of dingoes, as though the very act of accusing the indigenous wild dog of murder proved the Chamberlains were outcasts (women showed up at Lindy's trial wearing T-shirts with the slogan, "The Dingo Is Innocent"). 

   The picture has the sensibility of a strong piece of journalism. 
You never quite get inside the characters; it's not they who are fascinating but the situation they're in. 
Yet there are glimpses into the Chamberlains at home that are powerfully telling. 
Lindy becomes pregnant again after Azaria's death; she gets bigger and bigger as her trial approaches, and more tetchy. 
Her husband -- played sensitively by the Irish-born New Zealander Sam Neill -- finds himself overwhelmed by what's happened to them. 
He's a minister forced to question his faith in the most fundamental way. 
He's full of emotion; he picks at his head until it bleeds during the trial. 
Lindy, meanwhile, seems to be receding into her own flesh, occasionally emerging with a flash of anger. 

   This is a tough character to get hold of -- but Ms. Streep manages to do it. 
Though the accents, and certainly the coifs, ought to be old hat by now, this is a startling performance: You never see where it starts and where it ends.

   ESTONIA'S PARLIAMENT DECLARED the Baltic republic "sovereign." 

   The officials in Tallinn rejected Kremlin plans to modify the Soviet Union's constitution, saying the proposed amendments would restrict the rights of individual Soviet republics. 
The "declaration of sovereignty," which includes the right to veto Soviet laws, stops short of total independence. 
It calls for a treaty to be negotiated with Moscow to "determine the further status of Estonia." 
The vote on the declaration came after a day of debate by deputies from the Communist Party and Estonian government. 

   The passage of the proclamation is considered an unprecedented act of defiance, and it was uncertain how Soviet authorities would react to the move.

   New research indicates that some people with "safe" blood cholesterol levels still may run a high risk of heart disease, a finding that may overturn cholesterol guidelines released just last year. 
Four new studies suggest heart disease can strike individuals with especially low amounts of the body's "good" cholesterol. 

   Birth-control pill users face double the usual chance of heart disease, doctors report in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
But women who have stopped using oral contraceptives don't have any greater risk than women who never used the pills.

   Wilfred American Educational Corp. said it suspended dividend payments. 

   Wilfred, which runs career schools, blamed the suspension on declining enrollments and on its results for the third quarter, a $1.6 million loss, compared with year-earlier profit of $87,000. 

   Last month, a federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., indicted Wilfred, its president and 18 other employees, charging them with misusing student financial-aid funds. 
The company, which vowed to defend itself against the charges, said it believes that the indictment is factually incorrect and that Wilfred and its employees will be vindicated. 

   Wilfred's dividend for the fourth quarter would have been three cents a share, or a total of $272,000. 
The company said it would consider resuming dividends "in the future as operations warrant." 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wilfred shares closed at $3.375, down 75 cents.

   Japan took a big step toward a sweeping policy change as the lower house of the Diet, or parliament, passed a tax-reform package that includes a controversial new 3% levy on consumption of most goods and services. 

   Economists expect the overall impact of the tax package to be stimulative. 
The 3% consumption tax represents a reduction from the current tax on many commodities, and the package includes an income-tax cut and reductions in corporate and inheritance taxes. 
It should be a boon to American and European exporters, in part because it drastically cuts taxes on a host of products where these companies have a fighting chance in Japan -- most notably luxury cars, fine liquor and other high-quality image products. 

   Passage of the package by the lower house was a major political victory for Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, especially as he was able to persuade two opposition parties -- the Democratic Socialist Party and the Clean Government Party -- to take part in the vote. 
Other opposition parties boycotted the proceedings, but the participation of even part of the opposition is sufficient to give the deliberations political legitimacy. 

   The legislation still must clear the upper house of the Diet, but that is likely to prove a relatively minor hurdle in comparison with the struggle in the lower house yesterday and in a special committee last week. 
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had to force the legislation through the committee amid tumultuous protest from opposition parties, all of which boycotted the committee action. 

   To win the participation of the two opposition parties yesterday, Mr. Takeshita had to make concessions over the widening Recruit Cosmos Co. scandal. 
Among these, he agreed to set up a special Diet committee with power to call witnesses to investigate that scandal, in which senior politicians have been accused of being among those who received shares in the high-flying real estate company. 
The recipients later reaped big profits selling the shares after the Recruit Co. unit was listed. 

   But with the tax-reform bill no longer hostage to the Recruit scandal, further developments in the affair are more likely to depend on what the prosecutor investigating the case does than what the new Diet committee does. 
And so far, the prosecutor has indicted only one suspect -- a Recruit executive -- and that was on suspicion of attempting to bribe an opposition Diet member two months ago rather than in connection with the unlisted stock distribution. 

   The LDP also made concessions on tax reform itself, although it wasn't immediately clear what their impact would be. 
One concession, according to Kyodo News Service, would allow the authorities to delay imposition of the consumption tax during the six months after it is scheduled to be implemented on April 1, 1989. 

   The tax-reform package is designed to neither increase nor decrease revenue, although because of the staggered introduction of the various measures it will lower tax revenue next year by about 2.5 trillion yen ($20.34 billion). 
In the longer run, the consumption tax will broaden the tax base, because it will be imposed on purchases regardless of whether the purchaser has income from wages. 
Currently, Japan relies heavily on a wage-withholding tax, and with the population rapidly aging, that system threatened to leave an increasing number of Japanese paying no tax. 

   The government's Economic Planning Agency calculates that the net effect of the plan will be to boost consumer spending, private housing expenditures and private-sector capital outlays. 
The overall addition to gross national product growth, the agency says, would average 0.2 percentage point a year over a four-year period including the current fiscal year. 

   American and European exporters are expected to be helped both by the lowering of taxes on products they sell and by the expected increase in Japanese spending. 
In the longer term, the consumption tax could benefit foreign companies by helping to rationalize Japan's complicated distribution system. 

   Currently, a product can pass through as many as three or four wholesalers before it reaches a store. 
With the levying of a 3% tax on each transaction, Japanese businesses will be encouraged to reduce the number of middlemen. 
That also will cut the number of middlemen that foreign businesses have to face in getting their new products into Japanese stores. 

   Under the reform package, taxes on such items as golf equipment, watches, furniture, luggage and electrical appliances will be reduced to 3%. 
American and European makers have strong product lines in many of these areas. 

   The tax on big cars, which make up most of European and American auto exports to Japan, will be reduced from the current 23%. 
After a three-year phase-in, all cars will be taxed at 3%. 

   Taxes on liquor -- the largest French and British exports to Japan -- also will be reduced, in many cases by half for imported products. 
The current system taxes higher-quality alcoholic products at a higher rate than less-refined products, rather than taxing according to the amount of alcohol as most industrialized nations do. 
This gives an advantage to local brews.

<HL> International: Brazil Faces Uncertainty in Wake of Vote Showing Polarization and Leftward Tilt </HL>

   Brazil faces a year of deep political uncertainty following a sharp defeat for the government in local elections that revealed a polarized, left-leaning nation. 

   In a poll that heralded next year's presidential election, socialist or center-left parties won control of the major cities of the central and southern regions, where Brazil's economic power rests. 
President Jose Sarney's Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, the overwhelming winner in congressional elections two years ago, was humiliated. 

   The election, in which a weak and vacillating government paid the price for inflation of over 700% in the past year, established populist Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Labor Party and hard-line socialist Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party as serious candidates for the presidency next year. 
The possibility of either man winning that election will be viewed with deep misgivings by the armed forces and the conservative business establishment. 

   On the basis of early returns and projections described as reliable by national television, it was clear that the governing PMDB only retained some support in the countryside and less-developed north and northeast. 
While the right-wing Liberal Front and Democratic Social Party also did well in a few towns, the strongest trend was the leftward lurch in the major centers of industrial and financial activity. 

   In a remarkable turnabout -- apparently prompted in part by the controversial killing last week of three striking steelworkers by the army -- socialist Luiza Erudina of the Workers' Party became mayor of Sao Paulo, the most powerful municipal post in the country. 
She defeated favorite Paulo Maluf, a leading figure of the right-wing establishment. 
The Workers' Party also took the southern city of Porto Alegre and the port of Victoria, while Mr. Brizola's Democratic Labor Party won Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. 

   With strikes paralyzing the huge state steel and oil industries, and a recently signed anti-inflation "pact" showing no signs of controlling runaway price increases, the poll was held in a climate of volatility and uncertainty. 
Its result seems certain to exacerbate this nervousness and provoke a desperate scramble to rebuild a credible center of political moderation. 

   "Within a year of the presidential election, the center is in the worst possible condition, a stranded orphan, without a political message or a candidate," wrote leading commentator Villas-Boas Correa in the authoritative Jornal do Brasil. 

   Most analysts believe that only a successful attack on inflation can halt the trend toward polarization in the country, with its implicit threat of a new military takeover should the situation get out of control. 
Pressure will therefore be intense on the government, and particularly Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, to act. 
Both a so-called "fiscal shock," designed to cut the federal deficit to zero next year, and a wage and price freeze are being studied in the Finance Ministry. 
But finding political support for either will not be easy. 

   The dilemma facing the government is that the country's economic problems demand a new dose of austerity, while most Brazilians, as their vote showed, feel they already have suffered enough. 

   In this climate, there already are signs that the government may try next year to toughen its stance with creditor banks on the country's $120 billion foreign debt. 

   Certainly, Mr. Brizola and Mr. Lula favor a tough position on debt. 
And it seems likely that PMDB leader Ulysses Guimaraes, a major loser in the local poll, will now try to distance himself from President Sarney to reinforce his own battered presidential pretensions. 
He too may use the debt question as a platform. 

   But whatever Mr. Guimaraes does, it is clear that the period of the PMDB's hegemony is over. 
The party, which led the opposition to two decades of military rule that ended in 1985, has paid the price for appearing a many-headed monster, torn between its left-leaning reformist roots and those, like Mr. Sarney, who have tried to push it to the right. 

   With the PMDB in tatters, the reinforcement of Mr. Brizola and the emergence of Mr. Lula are certain to prompt a quest for a strong right-wing presidential candidate. 
The populist outgoing mayor of Sao Paulo, Janio Quadros, is widely viewed as a possibility for this role. 
He was the last previous president of Brazil directly elected, in 1960.

   Ireland named Finance Minister Raymond MacSharry to replace Peter Sutherland as a European Community commissioner. 

   The appointment, which was expected, was announced in Dublin by Prime Minister Charles Haughey. 

   Mr. MacSharry, considered the architect of Ireland's economic recovery over the past two years, will assume his post in January when a new EC Commission is formed. 
It isn't clear what responsibilities he will assume, though Irish sources said he has made it clear he would like to be put in charge of the important agriculture portfolio. 

   EC officials said several names are being considered for the agriculture post. 
Commission President Jacques Delors is holding talks with the 15 men and two women who will make up the new team, but final decisions on assignments could come as late as January. 

   The new group will carry the EC through 1992, by which time the 12-nation community hopes to have eliminated internal trade barriers. 

   Mr. Sutherland has been in charge of the EC's increasingly high-profile competition policy. 
He said in a statement that he expected to return to private life, where he would "work for the cause of European union."

<HL> Marketing &amp; Media: Arizona Panel Urges Ban on Premier </HL>

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Board of Pharmacy asked R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to stop test-marketing its "smokeless" Premier cigarette in the state pending a ruling from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on whether the product is a drug-delivery system. 
Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., promptly refused. 

   The board, saying it didn't know whether Premier is a drug-delivery system, requested more information from all interested parties so it could make a decision when it meets Jan. 17. 

   The board was ruling in a closely watched test case on Premier, sold in Arizona and Missouri since the start of October. 
The Arizona Cancer Society, the Arizona Lung Association and the state affiliate of the American Heart Association have sought a ban on sales. 

   "It's kind of a wimpy thing, but I can understand their position," Ben Chaiken, executive director of the lung association, said of the board's decision. 
A spokesman for the American Medical Association, which separately sought a determination that Premier is a drug, called the ruling "disappointing." 

   Premier heats rather than burns tobacco and its other contents. 
Critics say it isn't a cigarette but a nicotine-inhaling device and subject to regulation. 

   Reynolds, Winston-Salem, N.C., said Premier is being test-marketed under all applicable regulations. 
It also expressed appreciation to the board for taking time to gather more information. 
"We're glad they didn't jump to a quick conclusion," a spokeswoman said. 

   Anti-smoking advocates had hoped the board would declare Premier to be a drug delivery system, thereby pressuring the FDA to do likewise. 
But Al Brooks, a board member, said the board didn't have enough information to do so. 
The petition, he said, was filed only two weeks ago and much contradictory information has been presented. 

   "How do you resolve a situation like that without expert testimony?" he said. 
"You have a company doing business. 
You can't put them out of business immediately without a proper hearing."

<DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid all the financial market turmoil of the past year, the country's huge pension funds have barely tinkered with their asset mixes. 

   That's the conclusion of analysts at Boston Co., based on third-quarter data compiled by Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service, covering 198 public and private pension funds with about $350 billion of total assets. 

   The Trust Universe figures show that the median proportion of domestic equities in the pension funds did decline to 48% as of Sept. 30 from 54% a year earlier. 
But virtually all of the shift was the result of a decline in market values, according to analysis by Boston Co., a unit of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Fixedincome securities, meanwhile, rose to 31% from 28% of the median fund's assets, again reflecting changes in market value. 

   In short, most pension funds -- unlike retail investors -- "really have not done anything" to shift assets in or out of the stock market, says Fred Settelmeyer, vice president in charge of analytical services at Boston Co. 
The unusually high measure of uncertainty surrounding the markets and the funds' long-term orientation evidently have caused most pension funds to sit tight, he adds. 

   One important note: While the mix held steady, the total pool of assets declined about 5%, as corporations terminated overfunded plans, says Dale Stevens, director of the Trust Universe service.

<HL> Economy: Greenspan Says Federal Deficit Can't Be Outgrown, Stresses Cuts in Spending Over Boosting Revenues --- Fed Chairman's Remarks Imply a Flaw in Bush's 'Flexible Freeze' Plan </HL>

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that failure to bring down the federal deficit "courts a dangerous corrosion of our economy," but left to politicians the chore of fashioning a compromise that balances the budget. 

   Mr. Greenspan, who has in the past endorsed an increase in the gasoline tax, carefully avoided undermining President-elect George Bush's no-tax stance in testifying before the National Economic Commission, which was created by Congress to recommend ways to cut the deficit. 
"The emphasis has got to be very heavily, disproportionately -- and preferably wholly on the spending side," he said. 
The "congressional culture" makes it more likely that the government will spend new tax revenues rather than apply them to the deficit, he said. 

   But the Fed chairman also said the U.S. can't grow its way out of the deficit. 
The U.S. economy has so little slack that it can't grow fast enough to eliminate the deficit, he said. 
Politicians should concentrate on "reducing deficit directly and not hoping it will go away," Mr. Greenspan said. 

   Mr. Greenspan's comments, which also questioned continued inflows of foreign capital to finance the deficit, were taken to heart by traders in the financial markets and helped fuel a broad retreat in stocks, bonds and the dollar yesterday. 

   Mr. Greenspan's remarks may be interpreted as subtle criticism of Mr. Bush's so-called "flexible freeze," but the president-elect's deficit-reduction strategy relies not only on continued economic growth but also on restraining the growth in federal spending and on lower interest rates. 
Mr. Greenspan didn't specifically mention Mr. Bush's strategy. 

   He did all but promise that cutting the deficit will produce lower interest rates. 
"A credible long-term budget reduction, credible to financial markets, will lower both nominal and real {or inflation-adjusted} interest rates, perhaps significantly," he said. 

   Financial markets demand more than a one-year fix, Mr. Greenspan said. 
"They are waiting for . . . a longer-term solution. 
Until something concrete other than promises occurs, one cannot expect markets to react," he said. 

   He said the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, which forces across-the-board spending cuts if Congress and the White House miss predetermined deficit targets, has worked "surprisingly well" and suggested a similar permanent law might be effective. 

   Mr. Greenspan's testimony had something for everybody. 
House Budget Chairman Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.) was quick to cite Mr. Greenspan's remarks as support for his position that raising taxes is preferable to allowing deficits to continue. 
But fellow commission member Donald Rumsfeld, a Republican businessman, called attention to Mr. Greenspan's preference for spending cuts. 

   Although the commission remains far from any consensus, yesterday's all-day hearing wasn't marked by the sharp disagreements about taxes, social programs or defense that have characterized past open meetings. 

   Several commissioners sought reassurance from Mr. Greenspan that their work has a chance to succeed. 
Mr. Greenspan headed a commission that found a politically palatable way to resolve a Social Security financial crisis, a panel that once seemed as close to failure as the National Economic Commission. 

   "At least give us a little hope," pleaded Sen. Pete Domenici (R, N.M.). 

   Mr. Greenspan complied. 
"What happened there is very similar to what I gather . . . is happening here," he said. 
Just when the Social Security panel was about to give up, "the dam broke . . . which led us to a rather surprising end." 

   Following the hearing, Sen. Domenici said the odds of the commission succeeding are greater than 50-50 unless President-elect Bush "doesn't want it to." 
Mr. Bush's intentions will be clear once he makes his two appointments to the panel, the senator added. 

   Robert Strauss, the commission's co-chairman, said he now gives the commission a 70% chance of success. 
He wouldn't say whether he had been in touch with Mr. Bush or his aides about the timing or identity of his two appointments to the commission.

<HL> Bids for PTL Assets Rejected by Judge; Auction Set for Today </HL>

<DATELINE> COLUMBIA, S.C.(AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bankruptcy Court judge threw out pending offers for PTL's assets and ordered an auction today in the federal courtroom, with bidding to begin at $115 million. 

   "It's really wide open," M.C. "Red" Benton, bankruptcy trustee for the "Praise the Lord" television evangelical ministry, after a hearing. 

   PTL filed for protection from its creditors in June 1987, three months after its founder, Jim Bakker, stepped aside after admitting having had a sexual encounter with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn. 

   Though Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds still must approve any buyer, his order signals an approaching end to months of delays in selling PTL's satellite-television ministry, Heritage USA theme park and 1,700 acres of undeveloped property near Fort Mill, S.C. 

   Proceeds will go toward satisfying the ministry's debts, estimated to be as high as $130 million, including $55 million claimed by the Internal Revenue Service. 

   Judge Reynolds said neither a $115 million offer by Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick nor a $113 million bid by Vancouver businessman Peter Thomas were acceptable. 
In part, he said, it was because their offers contained clauses allowing the buyer to walk away from the purchase within a certain time after closing. 

   Mr. Benton had recommended Mr. Mernick as the ministry's buyer. 

   Neither Mr. Mernick nor Mr. Thomas would say whether they would bid at the public auction set for 9:30 a.m. today. 

   Mr.Benton said that the two men remain the most viable bidders but that he expects several other groups to try to meet the $1 million that Judge Reynolds has set as the entrance fee. 

   Mr. Bakker's own $172 million bid for the ministry fell through in September when he was unable to raise a $3 million down payment. 
He received a further setback last week when Judge Reynolds ordered Mr. Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former Bakker aide, David Taggart, to repay PTL almost $7.7 million in excessive benefits.

<HL> Heard on the Street: Harcourt's Refinancing Draws Mixed Reviews As $400 Million of Junk Bonds Are Readied </HL>

<SO> </SO>

<IN> HRD STK BON BBK TNM </IN>

<TEXT>
   The refinancing strategy of William Jovanovich, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich's venerable chairman, is getting mixed reviews from investors. 

   The publishing company is braving a sloppy market to issue $400 million of junk bonds through First Boston. 
Late yesterday, the talk was that Harcourt's senior bonds might be priced to yield 12 7/8%. 
The junior bonds' figure was 14%, a tempting half percentage point more than the average junk bond. 

   The refinancing's goal was to extend the term of some bank loans that Harcourt couldn't really afford, investors say. 

   Mr. Jovanovich has characterized the offering as the final step in Harcourt's costly recapitalization, undertaken in 1987 to fend off media magnate Robert Maxwell's takeover bid. 
As part of the plan, Harcourt recently sold 10 million new common shares at $9.50 each. 

   Harcourt shares, before being targeted by short-sellers, were as high as 12 7/8 earlier this year but closed yesterday at 8 3/4, off 1/8. 
Before the refinancing was announced, Harcourt's older 13 3/4% bonds due 1999 had been winners, trading at prices as high as 105, or 105% of their face amount. 
They're now at around 102. 

   Wall Street's gripe: The refinancing will actually raise Harcourt's debt slightly to about $2.7 billion, as well as increase its interest bill. 
With the economy and markets currently so uncertain, Harcourt should instead be selling major assets to reduce debt, as Borg-Warner is doing, some bondholders say. 

   Equity investors complain that Harcourt shouldn't have sold stock at such a low price. 
The offering diluted all shareholders' interest in the company, including the 40% stake of Harcourt insiders and employees. 

   "This is undoubtedly the worst time to refinance," says one investor. 
"There's a big junk-bond calendar and the stock market feels crummy." 

   Harcourt is apparently using some money from its stock sale to redeem $83.6 million of preferred shares with very high dividends that are held by First Boston, partly offsetting the rise in Harcourt's interest bill. 

   Fidelity Investments' Richard Cryan, whose portfolios hold the publisher's older 13 3/4% bonds, says "Harcourt was never a liquidation story. 
It was always a cost-cutting and run-the-company story." 
But he'd like to see Harcourt sell its theme parks and retire debt. 
The parks might fetch $750 million, he says, although Harcourt might face heavy taxes on such a sale. 

   However, Mr. Jovanovich gets credit for running a taut ship since the recapitalization. 
And Mr. Cryan is cheered by rising cash flows at Harcourt's textbook and theme-park units. 
"At 14%," he says, its new junior bonds might "look attractive." 

   After Walt Disney, Harcourt is the second-biggest operator of theme parks. 
Its new Sea World of Texas is kicking in quite a bit of money, although analysts worry about declining attendance at most theme parks. 
Harcourt's textbooks are on a roll, especially in Texas and California, investors say. 

   Kidder Peabody says Harcourt's cash flow from operations should rise to roughly $425 million in 1989, from perhaps $370 million in 1988. 
It says 1989's cash flow should be 1.3 times its total interest expense. 
A lot of Harcourt's interest is deferred and needn't be paid in cash until the early 1990s. 

   There's a nagging fear Mr. Jovanovich might make more acquisitions. 
In 1986, Harcourt bought Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston and W.B. Saunders. 
But John Berardi, Harcourt's treasurer, says "our existing bank agreement doesn't allow additional borrowing" until 1996. 
He indicates Harcourt's 1989 cash flow might be $500 million, before capital spending of $105 million at most. 

   Mr. Berardi says Harcourt's high bond yields reflect market conditions, not lack of faith in the company. 
Senior Harcourt managers have recently bought Harcourt stock and bonds and "I intend to," he says. 
Harcourt thinks its assets "are appreciating" and "feels comfortable" with its debts now that bank loans are extended an extra three years, he adds. 

   Harcourt is among the most leveraged of junk-bond issuers, according to Drexel Burnham Lambert's measure. 
It still has negative shareholders equity of about $1.4 billion. 
And its seasonal businesses in some periods this year have shown negative cash flow, says Gerald Unterman of Solomon Asset Management in New York. 

   But the money manager owns many Harcourt bonds and shares. 
Sale of the publishing unit alone would suffice to pay all debt "if the world falls apart," he says. 
At 14%, the new junior bonds would yield five percentage points more than 20-year Treasury bonds, he says, adding: "That's very cheap." 
Harcourt has "a nice big conservative banker, J.P. Morgan," he says. 

   Stock-analyst Bert Boksen of Raymond James says Harcourt may have had little choice in refinancing. 
He says it faced a $60 million cash-flow shortfall in 1989. 
"It had $175 million of debt installments due in 1989," he says. 
"That was the problem." 
Principal due in 1989 is now only $30 million.

<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court put off quickly deciding a dispute over Proposition 103, a voter initiative approved last week that would slash insurance rates. 

   Last Thursday, the court granted an insurance-industry request to temporarily stay implementation of the initiative, in which voters gave themselves a minimum 20% reduction in property and casualty insurance rates. 
On Monday, the state attorney general, who is charged with enforcing the new law, asked the court to lift the stay. 

   Yesterday, the court gave the initiative's consumerist proponents until next Tuesday to file briefs, and insurance industry opponents until Nov. 28 to respond. 
The court could still lift or modify the stay in the interim, but that is considered unlikely. 

   Insurance companies have assailed Proposition 103 as confiscatory and unconstitutional. 
But backers, arguing that the companies have shown no imminent financial harm, contend that the stay unfairly frustrates the will of the people. 
Making the situation even more frustrating for the proponents, since Election Day many insurers have stopped writing new policies or have raised rates, citing the uncertain status of the new law.

   The Heritage Plaza office building, an epic symbol of the depths of the Houston real-estate bust, was sold to an investment partnership for $110 million. 
Coventry Fund III of Houston, whose limited partners include Michigan Employees System Retirement Fund and Laudio III, a Spanish investment company, purchased the building from 261 Associates Inc., whose principal investor is Allen Paulson. 

   Wortham &amp; Van Liew built the $200 million, 53-story building in 1984, when other real-estate projects already were sagging. 
The developers boldly asserted that the lavish glass and granite structure would open up in time to enjoy a vigorous recovery. 

   But the market worsened and the development's partners sought bankruptcy-law protection. 
The building now has one million empty square feet and a vacancy rate of 92%. 

   Ron Howard, president of CMH Properties Inc., a Coventry affiliate, said the investment group knows of some large tenants shopping for office space and "we feel like there are some good opportunities to aggressively lease the property."

   The over-the-counter market, turning a relative lack of activity to its advantage, managed to sidestep some of Wall Street's selling wave. 

   The Nasdaq composite index of 4,574 OTC issues declined 4.34 to 367.79. 
The Nasdaq 100 index of the market's biggest non-financial issues -- including Intel, which rebounded yesterday -- dropped 5.16 to 331.05. 

   While the declines were substantial, they weren't as large as those the major exchanges suffered. 
The Nasdaq composite's 1.2% fall and the Nasdaq 100's 1.5% decline coincided with a 1.9% fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 1.7% drop in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index's 1.6% fall. 

   The lack of small-investor activity that has had OTC brokers complaining for months turned into an advantage yesterday, as many smaller issues avoided big tumbles caused by investor panic. 

   Still, Nasdaq already had been stumbling, and the composite index's close was nearly a six-month low. 
By comparison, the Dow Jones industrials closed at a 2 1/2-month low. 

   Intel jumped 3/4 to 22 3/4 on nearly 3.7 million shares, easily the most active issue on Nasdaq yesterday. 
The Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor company's shares had been rocked by market rumors early in the week that demand had slowed for the company's computer chips, causing returns of some chips. 
The company denied that any chips were being returned because of lack of demand. 
It said some were being returned in exchange for other types of chips. 

   "There's a lot of nervousness in the market. 
But Intel is one of the leaders in the OTC market, and as far as people's psychological feeling, it's important for it to do well," said Gary Rosenbach, manager of equity trading at Needham &amp; Co., New York. 

   Among other major Nasdaq stocks, MCI Communications lost 5/8 to 20 7/8, Microsoft slipped 3/4 to 46 1/4, Apple Computer fell 1 to 38, and Tele-Communications Class A declined 1/2 to 23 3/4. 
Two of Nasdaq's more heavily traded automotive issues fell, as Jaguar slipped 3/32 to 4 27/32 and Subaru of America declined 1/8 to 4 7/8. 

   Japan Air Lines, which has been soaring, managed to gain 1 5/8 to 251 bid, and NEC gained 2 to 75 1/4. 
But most other Japanese issues traded on Nasdaq fell. 

   The big loser was Newport Pharmaceuticals International, which plunged 3 to 9/16, a 61% decline, on nearly 1.2 million shares. 
The fall was one of the biggest by an OTC stock this year. 

   The Newport Beach, Calif., company, which now has market value of about $25 million, less than half of what it had before yesterday's trading, announced after the market closed Tuesday that it had dropped its plan to seek federal approval of its drug Isoprinosine for use in certain pre-AIDS conditions. 
It said tests had showed the drug to be ineffective for such acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related conditions. 

   CompuChem eased 1/4 to 8 3/4 after hitting a 1988 high Tuesday. 
The drug-testing company -- with market value of $55 million and contracts with 32 of the 82 Fortune 100 companies conducting drug tests -- had been boosted by new Transportation Department testing requirements for four million workers. 

   Takeover news spurred some of the big moves. 
Kansas City Life Insurance soared 5 3/4 to 38 1/4 bid after Torchmark said it is beginning a $43.50-a-share tender offer. 

   On the flip side, Coast Federal Savings &amp; Loan tumbled 3 3/8 to 12 5/8 as investor Hugh Culverhouse terminated a $71.9 million offer. 

   About 128 million shares changed hands. 
That was the heaviest volume since Oct. 21, but it was still light compared with the system's pace last spring or during 1987, when about 150 million was the daily average. 
There were 603 advancing issues with volume of 17.4 million shares and 1,488 declining issues on 64.9 million shares. 

   As a stabilizing influence on the OTC indexes, about 30 million of the shares traded were among the generally small Nasdaq issues that aren't part of the Nasdaq National Market System. 
They closed unchanged.

   Neither foreign creditors nor a global army of financial traders ever expected America to get serious about its budget and trade deficits this year. 
It was, after all, one of those years -- an election year, when the good times always roll and the merest hint of austerity is a no-no of the naughtiest kind. 

   But the election is over. 
And yesterday, from financial markets around the world, urgent signals sounded this message: It's time to get down to business. 

   Just two months after the weak dollar seemed well on the way to recovery, it has relapsed. 
It fell sharply again yesterday, and stock prices joined it. 

   The dollar plunged to 1.7166 marks yesterday from a record post-World War II high of 3.47 marks in February 1985. 
The dollar fell to 122.2 yen, near a record 40-year low, and continued to fall in trading in Tokyo early Thursday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 38.59 points, bringing its overall decline since mid-October to more than 140 points. 
"The financial markets are having another attack of nerves," says Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 

   To those foreign investors whose cash is desperately needed to finance the budget deficit, confidence in Washington's ability to address its problems is waning. 
"The new administration should make it clear as soon as possible how they will tackle the budget-deficit problem and propose a credible program about how they'll bring it down," says Aloys Bischofberger, Zurich-based chief economist of Credit Suisse. 

   Despite his election-campaign pledges to the contrary, "Bush won't be able to avoid a tax increase as well as cut expenditures," says Manfred Kunert, manager of foreign-exchange operations for DG Bank in Frankfurt. 
"Ultimately he'll have to convince people there's no way out; the U.S. will have to tighten its belt." 

   The markets' anxiety re-emerged only hours after a relatively benign report on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for September, which narrowed to $10.46 billion from $12.27 billion in August. 
The September figure fell within the range that had been expected. 
With no other financial or economic bombshells in earshot, the Commerce Department report ordinarily would have struck the markets as neutral if not bullish. 

   But the resurgent pessimism has broader causes. 
Since early September, when the dollar reached its 1988 peak, the bullish case for U.S. currency has fallen apart, point by point. 
President-elect George Bush, surprisingly to some, has clung to his repeated promise not to resort to tax increases to shrink the gap between federal revenue and spending. 
In the financial markets, this serves only to increase doubts that a Bush administration can make any real headway in reducing the deficit and weaning the U.S. from borrowed foreign capital. 

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan helped focus the issue, too, in testimony before the National Economic Commission yesterday. 
He called continued inflows of capital borrowed abroad "questionable." 
And he again pooh-poohed the notion that federal revenues created solely by economic growth can resolve the budget deficit. 
His remarks, though hardly new, were seized on by traders in the financial markets. 

   Actually, the trade deficit is continuing to shrink -- but not fast enough to make traders want to hold dollars very long. 
"There's no real improvement in the trade deficit," complains James Hohorst, a top currency trader at Manufacturers Hanover. 
"We aren't going to $5 billion, or $2 billion, or surplus." 

   The spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates also has narrowed, further damping any residual enthusiasm for the dollar. 
Last summer, U.S. rates were sufficiently higher than those in Japan and West Germany to continue attracting foreign capital and keep the dollar firm. 

   Economic policy makers here and in the entire Group of Seven nations -- the U.S., Great Britain, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan and Italy -- have reaffirmed their pledge to support the dollar's stability. 
But traders believe that the central banks of these nations are prepared to endure a further decline, so long as it is gradual. 
"The Fed isn't in the market {supporting the dollar} aggressively," a trader at a top West German bank said yesterday. 
"And the heavy speculators are into selling the dollar." 

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said last weekend that "the administration remains committed to exchange-rate stability." 
And Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson yesterday said "the dollar doesn't need to adjust lower." 
Still, Mr. Johnson gave no indication the Fed would increase interest rates to protect the dollar. 

   A continuing decline in the dollar would help American manufacturers sell their goods abroad. 
But it would also contribute to inflation, increasing the cost of imported goods to American consumers and encouraging domestic manufacturers to raise their prices as well. 

   The main guessing game on Wall Street is how much further the dollar will fall. 
"We're expecting a 10% drop by the end of next year," says David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. 
"I'm quite pessimistic," adds John Paulus, chief economist at Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. 
In fact, of eight economists polled by this newspaper yesterday, all but one saw the dollar at lower levels a year from now. 

   The prospects for the deficits, which are linked to the dollar's value, seem similarly bleak. 
"If there is no action to take down the budget deficit and the real {U.S.} economy is doing well, the trade deficit will deteriorate further because of higher imports," says Mr. Bischofberger. 
"An increase in exports of 25% to 30% {as the U.S. experienced this summer} is just not sustainable because of capacity constraints" on U.S. industry. 

   Indeed, Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor and former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, has continually argued that the U.S. currency must keep falling if the trade deficit is to be constrained. 
Just last week, he called for a 20% drop in the dollar. 

   Senior administration officials have said that Mr. Feldstein doesn't speak for the government. 
But "foreigners undoubtedly hear what he says," says Geoffrey Dennis, chief economist in the U.S. for the British brokers, James Capel &amp; Co. 

   "The dollar will remain vulnerable until {the budget and trade} imbalances are solved," says Mr. Bischofberger. 
"In the case of fiscal inaction, a sharp drop in the dollar wouldn't be out of the question." 

   That, in turn, could force the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest rates sharply "to defend the dollar and combat inflation" associated with a weaker U.S. currency, adds the Swiss banker. 

   Over the last two years, the U.S. budget deficit has declined from $220.9 billion in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30, 1986, to $155.1 billion in the year ended this September. 
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-reduction program requires that the deficit fall further to $136 billion in the current fiscal year and even more to $100 billion in the year that ends Sept. 30, 1990. 

   It is the fiscal 1990 budget that the incoming Bush administration will negotiate with Congress next year. 
That's the worrisome budget. 
Many expect strained relations between the Republican administration and an even stronger Democratic House of Representatives and Senate to frustrate the job of dealing with it. 

   A reduction in the budget deficit to $100 billion "isn't an impossible task, but {President Bush} will have to come up with a very, very faithful set of assumptions or the market won't believe him," says Mr. Dennis. 
If the U.S. doesn't make progress on the budget deficit, "the dollar's going to 100 yen is really going to be necessary to make big inroads in the trade deficit." 

   From all the turmoil, another fact emerges: Once again, the dollar is driving the prices of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. 
"With nearly a 10% drop in the dollar in recent weeks, it's become a hot topic again," says Mr. Paulus. 

   Yesterday began rather calmly for the world's most widely followed currency. 
The trade-deficit report caused barely a ripple in the markets, but traders began driving the dollar sharply lower after Mr. Greenspan's remarks were reported later. 

   The dollar's fall against the yen was tempered by what traders described as minimal yen selling by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
There wasn't any intervention to support the U.S. currency against the mark. 

   "We're going to continue to sell the dollar until the central banks tell us we can't," said Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations at Chase Manhattan Bank. 

   The props that held the greenback afloat through much of this year up to late August have failed to hold. 
These included improved U.S. trade statistics, cooperation among the Group of Seven central banks and higher U.S. interest rates that increased the allure of American fixed-income investments. 
Market professionals also felt that with the U.S. in the midst of a presidential election, Western central bankers would be motivated to avoid a dollar collapse. 

   The dollar climbed from its early-January record lows of 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks to 135.55 yen and 1.9210 marks in August. 
But as the election date crept closer, the dollar's underlying diseases began to become more apparent and the financial markets' confidence began to wane. 

   In the past few weeks, anxiety over the budget deficit has grown. 
There had been hopes that the bipartisan National Economic Commission would supply a plan to reduce the budget, after the election. 
But Mr. Bush has given the commission scant attention. 

   And the dollar's decline has accelerated since his election; it began to fall again even as the results were announced and it became clear he must work with a solidly Democratic Congress. 
Since Nov. 8 the greenback has lost 5% of its value in marks and 3% of its value in yen. 

   "If Reagan had trouble with the trade deficit, then Bush with his pledge of no new taxes is probably going to have trouble, too," says Manufacturers Hanover's Mr. Kellner. 

   As traders keep dumping dollars, Reagan administration officials worry that the decline is being driven by the markets' appetite for conspiracy theories and for unfounded rumors. 

   Some traders and analysts have expressed the belief that the dollar was propped before the election to help Mr. Bush win. 
There also are rumors that the Group of Seven conspired to permit the dollar to slide sharply after the election to cheapen the dollar value of American goods and encourage their export; that would be in contrast to the group's stated pledge to intervene to prevent any calamitous decline in the U.S. currency. 

   In support of their views, traders say that even intervention by the U.S. over the past few weeks has been half-hearted at best. 
They estimate that the Fed spent less than $200 million to support the dollar yesterday, a minimal showing in a nervous and apprehensive market. 
And traders found a bit puzzling Mr. Greenspan's reference to continued foreign capital inflows as "questionable." 

   "That surprised us all. 
That was a hint that foreigners be careful," says Mr. Kunert of DG Bank. 
The remark prompted foreigners to sell U.S. securities as well as dollars, he says. 
And he asks: "Why in bloody hell does he {Greenspan} do that while having the Fed intervene to support the dollar? 
It's a contradiction in itself. 
If they want stability in the market, he should keep his trap shut." 

   U.S. officials deny any shred of evidence for such theories and rumors, which, they observe, must have profited some traders who sold dollars to gain from further declines. 
"I know the currency markets are rational in the long run," says an official. 
"But in the short run, they can do some pretty bizarre things." 

   U.S. officials also believe that some foreigners fail to understand that new U.S. governments don't take charge immediately after an election and that Mr. Bush hasn't yet become president. 

   But, says Charles Minnaar, a vice president and trader at Chase Manhattan Bank, "That's precisely the point, why you sell right now, because nothing will be done {with the budget and trade deficits} till the new Bush administration takes office." 

   The dollar will rally, perhaps even today, and other rallies will occur from time to time, traders believe. 
But they think that the trend is still downward. 
"Fundamentally, the dollar has to go down," says Robert DeFina, economist at Security Pacific Bank. 
"The trade deficit at current levels isn't sustainable." 
A year from now, he says, the dollar may buy only 110 to 115 yen and 1.55 marks.

<HL> Morrison Knudsen Holds Talks to Sell Shipbuilding Unit </HL>

<TEXT>
   Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it is holding "substantive negotiations" on the sale of its troubled shipbuilding unit, as new boss William Agee undertakes the first major step in an anticipated shakeup of the company. 

   The Boise, Idaho, construction and engineering concern said it is in talks with a "management-led group of employees" at its National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. unit in San Diego. 
Morrison said that it "probably" will retain a minority ownership position in the unit and that it expects to record a one-time charge against earnings when the proposed transaction closes. 

   The company didn't disclose the sale price under negotiation or the size of the potential charge. 

   The talks didn't come as a surprise. 
While Mr. Agee's predecessor reportedly opposed divestiture of the shipbuilding operations, analysts assumed that Mr. Agee, brought in as chairman and chief executive officer in August, would put the unit on the block. 
Mr. Agee, who has since added the title of president, was brought on board to turn the company around. 

   A spokesman said Morrison wants to "direct its major management energies in those marketplaces where they feel they can do the best job and make the most money." 

   The bulk of the parent's revenue comes from its engineering and construction operations. 
For the first nine months, Morrison had a net loss of $97.8 million, including a $41 million loss from discontinued operations, on revenue of $1.52 billion. 

   The National unit, hampered by heavy competition for the little shipbuilding business available, has been a drag on Morrison's earnings. 
The unit had an operating loss last year of $10.7 million, and an operating loss of $19.9 million through the first nine months of this year. 
The latest deficit came despite a sharp rise in nine-month revenue to $133.5 million from $116 million for all of 1987. 

   The unit, which operates the West Coast's largest non-government shipyard, recently withstood a brief strike, which ended with employees granting pay and work-assignment concessions in exchange for a better retirement package and profit-sharing arrangements. 

   The National unit's backlog was boosted earlier this month to about $500 million by a $200 million contract to build a U.S. Navy ship. 

   Although Morrison's release was ambiguous about the structure of the proposed sale, it suggests some sort of buy-out involving a management group and an employee stock-ownership plan. 
Tax advantages designed to encourage employee ownership are making ESOPs increasingly popular as buy-out vehicles. 
Mr. Agee already has moved to establish an ESOP plan at the parent, in an apparent bid to boost the company's balance sheet. 

   The news of the sale talks was disclosed after the close of the market. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Morrison slipped 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $36.75 a share.

<G> EXE </G>
<DATELINE> BOONVILLE, Mo.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From a certain perspective, the election of George Bush can seem a pretty insignificant thing. 

   Atop a prehistoric Indian mound here, high as a hawk above the timeless silver curve of the Missouri River, author and local historian Robert L. Dyer weighs the next president and his place in the great sweep of history. "Who needs him?" he jokes. Then, more seriously, he says:
   "I hope he won't do anything radical. 
I assume he won't." 

   That about summarizes the expectations people have in this venerable, brick-built river town -- a place where an aging Daniel Boone once trapped and hunted, a place where young Dan Quayle more recently fished for votes on Main Street. 
The Bush-Quayle ticket rolled to a 57%-to-43% victory here, en route to a narrower Missouri victory. 
But this traditionally Republican, Heartland town of 6,959 neither expects, nor wants, sweeping change. 
If Boonville has given Mr. Bush a mandate for anything, it is a mandate for moderation. 

   "He's going to trend toward the center," predicts Boonville's Hillard Selck, a recent GOP state chairman and an architect of Mr. Bush's Missouri victory. 
That's a little more liberal than Mr. Selck, a conservative power broker rocking in his executive chair, would prefer. 
But he concludes: "I think that's where the nation wants him to be." 

   Citizens here don't really know what specific policies to expect of their next president -- because the Bush campaign didn't tell them. 
But hardly any of them believe Mr. Bush's "read my lips," no-new-taxes pledge. 
They're deeply worried about the federal budget deficit. 
To cut it, some Republicans say they'd support a gasoline-tax increase or even an income-tax surcharge. 

   Boonville suspects Mr. Bush is a closet nice guy who deliberately ran an empty, sometimes nasty campaign. 
The whole tone of the Bush-Dukakis contest dismayed many here. 
On election night, the marquee of Home Theatre Co., a video-rental store on Main Street, challenged voters: "Watch the Election or Rent a Movie. 
The Choice is Yours." 
It was no contest for some: VCR rentals jumped to 10 from a normal two or three. 

   And Boonville also suspects that the Republican candidate it saw on television was an artificial concoction of his campaign handlers. 
It's still waiting for the real George Bush to stand up. 

   "I've never yet observed a red-necked preppie in the White House," says lawyer Dale Reesman, a liberal Democrat. 
"We'll see which one he is." 
Like many here, Mr. Reesman believes -- hopes, anyway -- that the president-elect is "a better man than his campaign." 

   "He has a predisposition to be a kindly man," ventures the GOP's Mr. Selck, who's on a first-name basis with the president-elect. 
He thinks the campaign George Bush, with his negative ads and celebrated confrontation with CBS's Dan Rather, merely reflected "a calculated ire." 

   But now Boonville would like Mr. Bush to go beyond ire to action. 
An almost palpable sense of history hangs over this area: once a crossroads of ancient Indian trails, later home to two sons of Daniel Boone, still later peopled by a surge of German settlers who came to outnumber the original Kentuckians. 
And Boonville feels uneasy about the drift of current history. 
There is a sense, voiced by Republicans as well as Democrats, that the country is running out of time to confront its budget deficit. 

   Frank Thacher, 42 years old, is a funeral director who has never voted Democratic for president. 
Nevertheless, he thinks a 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, earmarked for deficit reduction, would be "a great idea." 
He'd also support an earmarked income-tax surcharge. 
Sitting in the living room of his antebellum house on High Street, he fears Mr. Bush has painted himself into a corner with his no-tax pledge. 
"You just never say never," he says. 

   James Conway, 62, is a bear of a man, looks like Georgia's Bert Lance and is as Democratic as Mr. Thacher is Republican. 
Taking morning coffee at The Steak House, he grouses that the Bush campaign papered over a gathering budget crisis with rhetoric that promised much and demanded little. 
"It's the same kind of impossible dream we Americans always fall for," he says. 

   Yet few here actively dislike Mr. Bush, not even the partisan Mr. Conway. 
"I think he'd make a good neighbor, and I wish I was rich enough to afford the subdivision where he lives," he says. 
The same cannot be said of Vice President-elect Quayle, notwithstanding his Steak House rally last August. 
"The first thing you hope for," says Democratic attorney Mark Wooldridge, "is that George Bush will live four years." 

   Beyond that, Boonville wants Mr. Bush to be "pragmatic," a word that crops up repeatedly here. 
Republicans expect Mr. Bush to emulate the Reagan themes of patriotism and military strength -- or, as 41-year-old Charles Murdock puts it, to keep "kicking the dog and waving the flag." 
But they also expect less ideology and more flexibility. 

   "I'd be disappointed if he were {just} a continuation of Reagan," says Bush voter Paul Mayginnes, 62. 
"I'm looking for modification, not radical change." 
That goes double for Democrats, who expect Mr. Bush to loosen Reagan-era restraints on domestic spending. 

   After nearly eight years of the Reagan presidency, a kind of morning-after mood prevails here. 
There is a sense that Mr. Reagan's successor hasn't any choice but to be a consolidation president. 
Given budget constraints and a re-energized Congress, some here believe a Bush administration may not be all that different from a Dukakis administration. 

   "I think these two gentlemen were a lot closer on basic issues than they let on," says school superintendent Greg Gettings, a political independent who voted for Mr. Bush. 

   "I don't look for him to do more damage," says Gill Jewett, a staunch Democrat who sits in a Main Street office that's decorated with mounted deer heads, antlers and wild turkey tail feathers. 
"I think the damage has already been done." 

   Eight years ago, Ronald Reagan captured the White House and the Senate in a kind of ideological holy war. 
But today Boonville seems quite comfortable with the prospect of a Democratic Congress checking a Republican White House. 
This old town seems ready for conciliation, not conflict. 
And its matter-of-fact citizens are taking the long view-as befits a place where, in the words of Mr. Dyer's Boonville history, "past and present slowly dissolve one into the other." 

   Bush supporter Mr. Thacher brings out the tattered, yellowing newspaper page he found while restoring his home. 
It's an 1864 write-up on a presidential candidate, Abraham Lincoln. 
Then he ventures a philosophical perspective of the next president and his prospects. 

   "I don't think any one man can mess up the country in four years," Mr. Thacher smiles. 
"There are too many checks and balances."

<HL> Media: Magazine for Homemakers Aims to Avoid Ad Clutter </HL>

<TEXT>
   The war for the American homemaker is already one of the most ferocious in the magazine business. 
Soon, there will be another player on the battlefield. 

   In January, a West German publishing company plans to launch a mass-circulation monthly here called First for Women. 
Its goal is to become an eighth among the so-called seven sisters -- something that hasn't been tried for years. 

   Whether the U.S. market has room for another women's service magazine is a hotly debated topic in the industry. 
The seven sisters -- Ladies Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, Better Homes &amp; Gardens, Family Circle, Redbook and Woman's Day -- appeal to women with the time to make their own Christmas ornaments and use a double boiler. 
Those women are steadily disappearing into the work force, many of them switching to such targeted magazines as Working Woman and New Woman, or to publications aimed at affluent, educated readers of both sexes. 

   But First's creators at Bauer Publishing are confident they'll succeed by treating their audience with a respect they claim the other magazines have sacrificed in the race to attract advertising. 
Although its amalgam of recipes, crafts, fashion, advice and homemaking tips will sound familiar -- "Free In This Issue! 
Complete chicken cookbook and 8 recipe cards to save," reads a cover line from the prototype -- First promises a cleaner, more readable package with less ad clutter. 

   Bauer, a U.S. division of Heinrich Bauer Verlag, will distribute seven million copies of the introductory issue of First, all to be sold in supermarkets for 25 cents each. 
To persuade retailers to push aside gum, candy or other magazines at their checkout counters, Bauer will let retailers keep the entire 25 cents. 

   After that, a circulation of about two million is planned, with a $1 cover price (the competition charges from $1.09 to $2.50). 
Bauer intends to pay top dollar in incentives and allowances to retailers who display the magazine prominently. 
It also plans to support the launch with $15 million in television advertising. 

   Bauer, which publishes two large women's magazines in West Germany, took a similar gamble in the U.S. women's market in 1984. 
It introduced Woman's World, a weekly tabloid that -- as First plans to do -- limited the amount of advertising it would accept and restricted those ads to conventional shapes and sizes. 
Woman's World, Bauer's only U.S. publishing venture until First, now sells 1.4 million copies a week. 

   "Everyone said these crazy Germans had a death wish to come into this country with another women's service product," says Todd Selbert, advertising director of Woman's World and First. 
"We proved them wrong." 

   But some magazine analysts think 1989 is a less propitious time for a magazine launch than 1984 was. 
"I think they're nuts," says Allan Mottus, a New York marketing consultant. 
"There has never been a time of so much uncertainty in the magazine business." 

   David Orlow, a magazine consultant with Periodical Studies Service in New York, argues that First won't survive if it simply repackages standard women's magazine fare. 
"There's so much competition," he notes, "and prices have been forced so low, that there just isn't room for another magazine." 

   Mr. Orlow is referring to the deeply discounted ad rates among women's service magazines. 
Advertisers say the seven magazines are so similar editorially that their primary distinguishing feature is cost. 
In recent years, as some categories of advertising diminished, other advertisers pressured the seven sisters for better deals. 
"Whoever gave the deepest discounts got the business," says John Beni, publisher of McCall's. 
Now, he says, the magazines are turning away from pure discounting, trying to attract advertisers with "added value" -- marketing or promotion packages to enhance the value of the advertising. 

   While Bauer refuses to discuss specifics, it claims First will pay more attention to editorial presentation. 
It also boasts that First will be far less accommodating to the wishes of advertisers. 

   While the other magazines sell at least 50% of their pages to advertisers, First says it will limit ad pages to 33% of the magazine's 150 pages. 
First will run more ads on the less desirable left-hand pages, and it won't jump stories to the back of the magazine. 
Also, First won't accept ads in peculiar shapes and sizes that interrupt the smooth flow of editorial columns. 

   "That's going to be a tough sell," says George Hayes, a senior vice president at the New York advertising agency McCann Erickson Inc. 
"If you're selling deodorant, people don't really care about it that much, so you have to arrest them. 
Some advertisers need the checkerboard look to get some attention." 

   Other ad executives say First's attitude toward advertising may sound noble but may not be very farsighted. 
"We're accustomed to publications acknowledging that 50% of their revenue stream comes from advertising; they pay attention to advertisers," says Leo Scullin, director of print media at Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. "That's not what this magazine does. 
They seem to be telling advertisers that they don't really want them there." 

   It's not that Bauer doesn't want advertising in First, Mr. Selbert counters. 
It's simply that the company believes reader loyalty is dwindling as the other magazines make themselves too hospitable to advertisers. 
"You draw a line, and the seven sisters will cross it," Mr. Selbert contends. 
"Women know the reason these magazines are so weighty is because they're more than half advertising. 
And those odd-sized ads make these magazines very tough sledding for the women who buy them." 

   Mr. Beni of McCall's doubts that the amount or kind of advertising in the seven sisters puts off readers. 
"We measure readership, so we can tell when a reader reacts to something," he says. 
"If we saw a significant difference in reader reaction, we'd do something about it." 
And it certainly isn't the advertisers who are complaining about clutter, he adds: "Who's creating those units in the first place?" 

   Although the seven sisters haven't grown much in recent years, they're still popular enough to attract millions of readers and many advertisers. 
"If you look at the circulation and amount of revenue involved, it must look pretty attractive," says Mr. Hayes of McCann Erickson. 
"It's like the soft-drink business. 
People say, 'If I could just get 1% of the business . . .' They don't realize getting 1% is like climbing Mount Everest."

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether a group of former University of Pennsylvania classmates now on Wall Street may have swapped and illegally traded on inside information about undisclosed takeover deals, people familiar with the investigation said. 

   Trades by at least five persons are being examined in the investigation, which the SEC's New York office began in mid-1987. 
Four of the traders are members of the New York Commodities Exchange, and Wall Street sources said they only dabble in stocks. 
The classmates' case may overlap several widely publicized insider-trading investigations, including probes of the so-called "Yuppie Five" trading ring and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said people familiar with those investigations. 

   Much of the trading under investigation in the classmates' probe took place in 1986 and 1987 and was channeled through a small discount brokerage, Andrew Peck Associates Inc. 
As reported last summer, the SEC has subpoenaed customer records at Peck. 
Federal investigators also are examining whether Peck employees may have emulated any improper trading for their own or the firm's account, people familiar with the investigation said. 

   The identities of the five traders under investigation were reported yesterday by the Washington Post. They are:
   --Jeffrey Schwarz, a 1981 Penn graduate and a former partner at the arbitrage firm of Kellner DiLeo &amp; Co., whom friends say now runs his own trading firm. 

   --Mark Dickstein, a 1980 graduate described as a silver trader with his own trading firm, Dickstein &amp; Co. 

   --Craig Effron, a 1981 graduate and gold-trading specialist who also runs his own business. 

   --Curtis Schenker, a 1980 Penn graduate and commodities trader. 

   --Chris Engel, a 1981 graduate who also is a commodities trader. 

   None of the five men returned phone calls to their offices. 

   A spokeswoman for the New York Commodities Exchange said Messrs. 
Dickstein, Effron, Schenker and Engel hold seats there. 
A spokeswoman for the New York Mercantile Exchange said Messrs. 
Dickstein and Effron are members. 

   A Wall Street executive who knows some of the five described them as "quintessential yuppies; these guys come right out of novels like 'Bonfire of the Vanities' and 'People Like Us.' 
They were real high livers." 

   A Wall Street friend of all five said Mr. Schwarz is the most serious stock trader of the group. 
"Most of the stuff these guys traded on was gossip," the friend said. 
"These guys are basically commodities traders who have dabbled in stocks." 

   Mr. Schwarz told a Wall Street Journal reporter in June that the SEC had obtained the records of calls made from his home telephone. 
He also confirmed that he had talked periodically with Robert Salsbury, a former Drexel arbitrager convicted as a member of the Yuppie Five ring. 
Mr. Salsbury received a degree from Penn in 1981, and at one time the two men lived in the same Manhattan building. 
Although SEC investigators have interviewed Mr. Salsbury, it's not clear what role if any he played in events being examined in the current probe. 

   SEC attorneys also are understood to be examining a possible role in the classmates' trading by Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader and 1980 Penn graduate who is under indictment in a securities fraud case involving Princeton/Newport Partners. 
Mr. Newberg was a senior trader in Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., operation run by Michael Milken. 
Mr. Milken was named in a civil securities-fraud suit filed by the SEC last September, and is under criminal investigation by the government for insider trading. 
Mr. Milken has said he is innocent of any wrongdoing. 

   Gerald Lefcourt, an attorney for Mr. Newberg, denied that his client was under investigation in the classmates probe. 
"There's no such probe that I know of," Mr. Lefcourt said. 
"We haven't been asked anything. 
This is the first we've heard of it." 

   Julian Friedman, an attorney for Mr. Schwarz, denied that Mr. Schwarz engaged in any wrongdoing "in connection with Andrew Peck, Bruce Newberg, Robert Salsbury or trading in any other securities." 

   In the June interview, Mr. Schwarz said he had encouraged his college friends to trade through the Peck firm. 
"I would probably know 10 people who trade at Peck. . . . 
We all went to school together, we were all friendly," Mr. Schwarz said. 
"I know I told a number of friends these guys (at Peck) were good at execution. 
I know at least half a dozen people I told to open accounts there." 

   Gene R. McHam, Peck's president, declined to discuss the SEC investigation or allegations that Peck employees may have copied any improper trades. 
"We do not fuel unsubstantiated stories by making any comment to any source whatsoever," he said.

   Why would anyone put kissing Dutch kids, the Seven Dwarfs or a concrete fawn out in the front yard? 

   Pamela Frese has a few theories. 

   A professor of anthropology at Wooster College in Ohio, Ms. Frese began looking into such ornaments in 1982. 
She had been studying marriage rituals, and the decorations on wedding cakes inspired her to consider those planted on lawns. 

   On the basis of random interviews conducted nationwide, she contends that people typically buy the swans, birdbaths and small concrete animals to "make the home more of a natural place." 

   Deer and squirrels, for example, are the frequent choice of urbanites who long for the country. 
To make the stiffs look more realistic, some people pose them peeking out of bushes. 
"I was amazed at how much time people devote to positioning these things," she says. 

   Ms. Frese also found that the ornaments, which were first mass-produced around the turn of the century, are often holiday gifts or heirlooms. 
"Women inherit the swans of their mothers or the birdbaths of both parents," she says. 

   Then there's the ever-popular mirrored sphere on a pedestal, called a witch's ball by some and a gazing ball by others. 
For the superstitious, Ms. Frese explains, it's supposed to ward off evil: Legend holds that witches can't touch it and survive. 

   And what about the pink flamingo? 
Ms. Frese says she has intentionally stayed away from that and other controversial figures -- such as the black jockey holding a lantern and the peasant leading a burro -- because of their sensitive racial and class overtones. 

   Valerie Baker, the owner of Baker's Lawn Ornaments in Somerset, Pa. -- which offers 300 items, including a 6-foot-tall Holstein cow -- says lawn ornaments are subject to fads. 
Geese are big this year, she notes, as are fabric sheep -- basically, stuffed animals on a stick. 
Perennial favorites are commonly updated for a fresh look. 
The Dutch boy kissing the Dutch girl, for instance, now comes "full-figured" (early models were flat on one side). 

   Ms. Frese, who plans to present her findings to the American Anthropological Association, refuses to discuss her own feelings about the objects of her research. 
"Remember," she says, "anthropologists can't make any value judgments."

<HL> The Four Seasons Needed Sprucing Up, But Change Is Risky --- A Restaurant Wouldn't Wish To Scare Away the Rich; A Job Calling for Subtlety </HL>
<AUTHOR> Roger Ricklefs (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>

<TEXT>
   The Four Seasons just spent more than half a million dollars redecorating. 

   "Looks the same as always," says Stephen R. Burzon, the publisher of Metropolitan Home. 
"I haven't noticed any changes," adds fashion designer Bill Blass, another Four Seasons regular. 

   In other words, the project was a great success. 

   The Manhattan restaurant may not have the greatest food in town and its prices are out of sight, but it is a mainstay of powerful people with company credit cards. 
According to a Wall Street Journal survey last year, it is the favorite restaurant anywhere of chief executives of big corporations. 
So why mess with success? 

   The Four Seasons' owners had hoped that the money they were lavishing on understated refurbishment would give the establishment a slightly warmer look, warmth being a big part of the restaurant's allure. 
They wanted to avoid doing to the Four Seasons what the competition on West 52nd Street did to the 21 Club. 
It redid itself last year and in the process discombobulated some old regulars. 
Adding to the risk: The Four Seasons, designed three decades ago at a cost of $4.5 million by the eminent architect Philip Johnson, is considered by some to be a paragon of modern architecture. 

   The Four Seasons hasn't always had to worry about carefully nurturing success. 
In its salad days and under previous ownership, it went through some hard times. 
Fifteen years ago it was actually losing money. 

   In the early 1970s, power lunchers looked the place over, saw tourists, and were horrified. (It took Restaurant Associates more than a year to unload the property.) 
But the eventual new owners, Tom Margittai and Paul Kovi, hit upon a winning formula: They gave habitues of the Four Seasons what they seem most to want -- comfort and attention, both of which are rarities in Gotham. 

   As soon as Mr. Margittai and Mr. Kovi bought the restaurant in 1973, they began training staff members to study religiously their customers' desires. 
"Eventually, the staff got used to the fact that I would ask what people had ordered, and they remembered," Mr. Margittai recalls. 
"For instance, the second time one customer came, I asked, Did he order Bombay gin straight up again?" 
Mr. Margittai recalls. 
The third time, the captain was able to ask the customer, "Bombay gin straight up, sir?" 

   The restaurant knows that at some point each spring, Morton L. Janklow, the lawyer and literary agent of great clout, switches from red wine to iced tea. 
"Around April, they'll ask, 'Is it time for the iced tea yet?'" he says, pleased. 

   Customer Paul M. Schlem, the chairman of Vintners International Inc., a large wine producer and distributor, adds: "They know I don't want water at my place; I believe water is for washing." 
The typical dinner customer buys wine in the $35 to $55 range. 
But those who wish to live a little can have a nice 1945 Chateau Latour for $850. 

   When you call the Four Seasons for a reservation, a card is prepared with your name on it. 
When you show up for lunch, the host discreetly passes the card to the captain. 
So both are able to address you by name. 
"The card isn't passed secretly -- but fast," Mr. Margittai says. 
Visit the Four Seasons for the first time and your guests won't have a clue that you've never been there before, he adds. 

   And if you are a valued regular, the Four Seasons has been known to go well beyond the call of duty. 
A prized customer was served dinner by the Four Seasons in his hospital room in Boston, according to Alex von Bidder, the restaurant's vice president and general manager. 

   "They care for you, at least they make you feel they care for you," says Joni Evans, the publisher of Random House adult books. 
Adds Geraldine Stutz, another Random House book publisher and Four Seasons regular, "Warmth is important in New York because there isn't so much of it." 

   Customers have been known to test the limits of the Four Seasons' warmth, which, according to the sign next to the cloakroom, doesn't extend to men or women in jeans. 
And one day last month, the son of a regular, who happened to be wearing a nylon windbreaker, complained to Mr. Margittai that the bar was refusing to serve him. 
"We're gonna spend a couple of hundred bucks on champagne," he remarked. 
"I just made two movies in Hollywood, and nobody there wears a jacket." 

   "This isn't Hollywood," Mr. Margittai explained. 
But when the customer refused to borrow a coat proffered warmly by the restaurant, Mr. Margittai found another way to save the day. 
He had the young sport and his friends served their expensive champagne in a private room. 

   For all the attentiveness, even enthusiasts often say the food alone isn't worth the price. 
In the Pool Room, the more formal of the restaurant's two big dining rooms, a $33.50 plate of liver is the cheapest entree on the dinner menu. 
A summer beefsteak tomato, carved at table side as a first course, is $8.50. 
The fettuccine, with shavings of white truffle, costs $48. 

   Not counting tax and tip, the average customer runs up a bill per person of $55 for a Grill Room lunch to $68 for a Pool Room lunch, Mr. Margittai says. 
A full meal with appetizer, dessert and a couple of drinks can easily enough total $100 a head, including tax and tip. (The restaurant runs TV commercials advertising a pre-theater, "prix fixe" dinner at $41.50.) 

   The Four Seasons is "probably New York's most exorbitantly expensive restaurant," wrote food critic Mimi Sheraton in her book "Mimi Sheraton's Favorite New York Restaurants." 
She thinks that "As good as the dishes can be here, there is simply not enough culinary consistency to justify the price." 
To acerbic critic Seymour Britchky, the "gravlax" is "almost inedible." 
Fish-loving readers put off as he is by the salmon might also wish to stay away from the snapper, which Mr. Britchky says is "grilled until dry." 
One could also say that a restaurant that seats 400 is too big to be great. 

   Most food writers, however, find dishes to praise, and the influential food critic of the New York Times, Bryan Miller, gave the restaurant three coveted stars (of a possible four) in his 1985 review. 

   To many customers, the company counts as much as the solicitude. 
On a recent day, lunch guests included Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger, Mr. Blass, investment banker Peter G. Peterson, financier Sanford I. Weill, and a score of lesser men and women, all eminent enough. 
"It is lunch as theater," says Art Cooper, the editor in chief of Gentlemen's Quarterly. 

   It isn't surprising that this busy restaurant makes money, even though it is located at street level in the Seagram Building, in a decidedly high-rent neighborhood. 
The owners won't say what their lease costs them. 
But their revenue has risen to about $14 million a year from $2 million 15 years ago, Mr. Margittai says. 

   So the challenge in redecorating was to bring about change without fomenting a revolution. 
Nearly everybody has admired the modern setting. 
The Four Seasons is a spacious, airy place with $600 Mies van der Rohe chairs and 20-foot ceilings. 
The clubby Grill Room has walls of French walnut. 
A huge Picasso graces the corridor between dining rooms. 
And even the men's room is done in marble and ebony. 

   The restaurant's designer, Mr. Johnson, at the age of 82, still has lunch in the Grill Room most days and orchestrated the redecoration, which has been inching along over the past few years. 
For its half million dollars, the Four Seasons has new table lamps, china, salt and pepper bowls, new upholstery, and many little things specifically meant to be nearly imperceptible. 
Mr. Johnson himself designed the new $80,000 multicolored carpet, says Mr. von Bidder. 
For the sake of perfectionism, a computer made sure that the diamonds in the pattern fall on precisely the same spot on each step of the Four Seasons' staircase, but who would notice?

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. reported that it narrowed its net loss for the third quarter, to $36.5 million from $38.3 million the year earlier. 

   The improvement was led by results from this broadcasting concern's syndication and licensing division, which reported an operating profit of $6 million, compared with an operating loss of $7 million the year earlier. 
The company cited strong international sales and increased licensing of movies from its MGM film library. 

   Turner's cable productions division posted a 42% rise in operating profit, to $17 million, on a 27% increase in revenue, to $63.3 million. 
The company cited improved profit margins in the division, which consists mainly of Cable News Network and Headline News operations. 

   Operating profit in the broadcasting division declined 81%, however, to $3.3 million, despite a 20% rise in revenue, to $60.9 million. 
The company cited a $15.8 million write-down of the value of internally produced programming. 

   Turner, which had a 31% rise in total revenue to $198.7 million from $152.1 million, reported the net loss because of continuing debt costs and amortization charges. 

   In the first nine months, the company had a net loss of $76.4 million compared with a loss of $104 million in the 1987 period. 
Revenue rose 27% to $581.8 million from $459.3 million.

<HL> Law: Judge Says United, Machinists Sought To Block Pilots' Bid With Labor Pact </HL>

<IN> AIR </IN>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge struck down a provision of a contract between United Airlines and its machinists union, finding that the covenant was designed solely to block a bid by the carrier's pilots to buy the airline. 

   In a 61-page opinion, issued in Chicago last weekend, Judge James B. Zagel ruled that the machinists, UAL Corp., its directors and its United Airlines unit violated the Railway Labor Act by putting into the machinists' contract last year a covenant that the judge and the machinists' union called a "poison pill." 

   The decision is likely to affect future moves by unions to try to use labor contracts to block unwanted takeover proposals. 
It also may help pave the way for the pilots to proceed with their bid to buy United. 

   In May, the pilots offered to buy all of the common stock of United's parent for $110 a share. 
The proposed purchase, which UAL and the machinists oppose, would result in the ownership of United by one or more employee stock ownership plans in which the United pilots and noncontract employees would participate. 

   However, the machinists and the company had a contract provision that if an ESOP is offered or provided to any of United's union employees, United must offer an ESOP to its other unions too. 
If other unions were to accept the plan, the pilots' bid for ownership or even control of the carrier would be impossible. 

   The pilots said they couldn't proceed with their proposed acquisition as long as this provision in the machinists' contract remained in effect. 
Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank unit, which has agreed to help the pilots finance their bid, also conditioned its financing on the removal of the covenant. 
In striking down the machinists' covenant, Judge Zagel cleared at least one hurdle to the pilots' proposed acquisition, which is pending. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, UAL shares closed at $97.375, down 12.5 cents. 

   A provision that the judge failed to strike down enables the machinists to demand that their contract be reopened for negotiation if anyone buys control of the carrier before the contract expires in a year. 

   The judge said he declined to rule on that provision because it is governed by the law of the state of Delaware, where UAL is incorporated. 
He said state law claims under Delaware law "are pre-empted" by the federal Railway Labor Act. 

   "There is no question that {the machinists union} sought to stop the pilots' attempted takeover proposal in order to protect its members and that it viewed the reopener and ESOP clauses as means to that end," the judge wrote. 
The judge said United's management accepted the provisions to defeat "the pilots' attempted takeover." 

   It isn't clear whether UAL or the machinists union will appeal the decision. 
Officials of the union weren't available to comment. 
United declined comment. 

   A spokesman for the United unit of the Air Line Pilots Association said the pilots are "jubilant" over the ruling, but he said the union's attorneys are reviewing its options, including whether to appeal aspects of the ruling unfavorable to the pilots.

   Echo Bay Mines Ltd. said it plans to bring its Kettle River gold mine in Washington into production in early 1990. 

   It said it expects the mine to produce 110,000 ounces of gold a year in the first two years of operation. 

   Echo Bay, which produced 500,500 ounces of gold in 1987, owns 70% of the Kettle River project. 
It said Crown Resources Corp., Denver, and Gold Texas Resources Ltd., Vancouver, British Columbia, each own 15%. 

   Echo Bay, a gold mining concern, said it will cost $60 million to bring the project into production. 
It said the mine, which is estimated to have a seven-year life, is expected to produce 85,000 ounces of gold a year after two years of operation.

<HL> Dollar Scares Foreigners Off U.S. Stocks --- Currency Fall Stirs Buying Overseas </HL>

<SO> </SO>

   Foreign investors, terrified by the falling dollar, are shunning U.S. stocks. 

   Last year, foreigners had such a voracious appetite for U.S. stocks that mere rumors of foreign buying were enough to spark a market rally. 
But the crash scared them away, and they haven't come back. 

   Their latest rationale for staying out of stocks is the weakening dollar, which dominates the linkage of the U.S. market to those overseas. 
The more the dollar falls, the less foreign investors earn when they translate U.S. holdings into their domestic currencies. 

   "We have had a hard time selling U.S. stocks in Japan," concedes Yoshitaka Yamashita, an executive vice president at Nomura Securities Co.'s U.S. subsidiary in New York. 
From January through September, Japanese investors were net buyers of $1.05 billion of foreign equities -- not all of which were in the U.S., according to the Ministry of Finance. 
That compares with last year's net purchases of $16.87 billion. 

   Overall, foreigners may have increased their buying of U.S. stocks a bit this summer, preliminary evidence indicates, following their total retreat in the wake of the crash. 
But the pickup was modest, and the latest jitters over the dollar's plunge, the aging U.S. economic expansion and the still-mountainous U.S. trade and budget deficits don't augur well for the future. 

   Besides, nearly everyone contends there are greener pastures elsewhere. 

   For instance, West Germany's and Japan's stock markets are booming -- in large part because the mark and yen are strengthened as the dollar slips. 
Over the past three trading days, the Tokyo stock market has set as many new record highs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 37.52 points, or nearly 2%. 

   "The dollar is the factor driving the Japanese equity market" higher, says Peter Green, president of James Capel &amp; Co.'s U.S. unit. 
"The fear {in the U.S.} is that with a weak dollar, we may see an increase in interest rates, whereas in Japan we may see a decline in interest rates. 
The Japanese are going to invest at home and get better returns at home, without the currency risk." 

   In comparison with Japan's record-setting market, U.S. stocks would seem to be bargains; but even with a strengthening yen that's not enough. 
Japanese investors acknowledge that "the U.S. market is very cheap," says Mr. Yamashita of Nomura, "but they don't believe it will pick up." 

   This week, reassuring comments from U.S. officials, including President-elect George Bush, and others helped stabilize the dollar in advance of today's report on the U.S. trade deficit for September. 
But foreign investors regard this as a brief hiatus in a prolonged decline. 

   "The downward risk of the dollar is definitely higher than its upward potential, not only in the short-term but also medium- and long-term," says Erwin W. Heri, director of the financial analysis and investment advisory division at Swiss Bank Corp. in Basel. 

   Some foreign investors already may have sold into the U.S. market's October rally and reduced their holdings of American equities, say brokers. 
A few days ago, a Dutch insurance executive told a big foreign securities firm that his company had bailed out of U.S. stocks last spring and hasn't come back. 

   And they won't, analysts say, until there is less uncertainty about the U.S. economy and the new administration and Congress that take office in January. 
"In terms of overseas investment flows into U.S. stocks, the future looks bleak until we have concrete policies to deal with the budget and trade deficits," says Mr. Green of James Capel. 

   In the first half of 1988, foreigners dumped a net $171 million of U.S. shares. 
That compares with purchases of $18.49 billion in the first six months of 1987. 
Preliminary evidence points to overseas investors adding $824 million to their portfolios in July along with some net purchases in August, according to the Securities Industry Association, a trade group. 

   But everyone agrees that overseas investors won't come close to matching the $16.26 billion of U.S. equities they picked up last year. 
"Essentially, it's a psychological reaction to October 1987," says Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman of the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. "World-wide, people just went home, became more conservative and stayed with the devil they know." 

   But safety isn't the only factor. 
European markets are underpriced compared with New York, argues Helmut Saurer, management committee member in charge of portfolio management at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. in Zurich. 
While the price of the overall U.S. stock market is 12 to 13 times the per-share earnings of corporations, the price-earnings ratios of most Continental markets are 10 to 12 or even lower. 

   In addition, Mr. Heri of Swiss Bank Corp. argues that corporate profits -- especially those in the U.S. -- are expected to fall next year. 
"We're probably at the high point, if not the turning point, of the economic cycle; we've had six to seven years of growth," he says. 
A risk-averse investor whose base currency is either the Swiss franc or West German mark wouldn't put money into U.S. stocks in the current environment, adds the Swiss banker. 

   As if the falling dollar weren't enough, the U.S. stock market, unlike many of its counterparts around the globe, must compete for investment dollars against relatively high yields in the bond market. 

   Mr. Yamashita of Nomura points out that, as a result, U.S. bonds offer more comfort than equities to those Japanese investors who still want to diversify into dollar-denominated investments but are leery of the currency's long-term stability. (In addition, many Japanese corporations have plowed a lot of money into U.S. takeovers and real estate.) 

   After unloading a net $176 million of U.S. Treasury securities in all of 1987, foreign institutional and individual investors bought a net $11 billion of Treasury securities in the first half of this year. 
They also added $8.9 billion of U.S. corporate bonds to their portfolios. 

   But even that interest seems to be waning before the specter of a weakening dollar. 
Excluding central banks that buy Treasury securities as part of their intervention activity to stabilize currencies, foreigners' net purchases of Treasuries in the second quarter fell to almost half those of the first. 
And though Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds are still running ahead of last year, they plunged to $3.42 billion in September from a high of $14.02 billion in July. 

   "The Japanese investor seems to be reluctant to invest" in the U.S., says William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president in charge of the fixed-income department at the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co. 
"The bottom line is the dollar."

<TEXT>
   The Sept. 29 editorial-page piece by Fred Smith, "Cap the Financial Black Holes," identifies some important policy issues regarding the financial difficulties of U.S. banks and thrifts. 
Mr. Smith discusses the perverse consequences that can result from providing explicit 100% deposit guarantees to troubled financial institutions. 
He also notes concerns about Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. settlement practices that treat certain institutions as "too big to fail." 

   We share Mr. Smith's concerns. 
We recently distributed a study, "The Texas Thrift Situation: Implications for the Texas Financial Industry," that identifies some of the negative consequences that special assistance to troubled financial institutions, including 100% deposit guarantees, can have on those institutions that have not received the special assistance. 

   Our study indicates that concerns about the most troubled banks and thrifts in Texas have spilled over to the stronger institutions. 
This is evidenced by the interest-rate premiums that are now required on deposits of virtually all the banks and thrifts in Texas, including those with higher average capital ratios than banks and thrifts outside the state. 

   During the first quarter of 1988, the average premium on interest-bearing deposits at Texas thrifts was 74 basis points, with the weakest thrifts paying 132 basis points more for their funds than thrifts outside Texas. 
The top quarter of Texas thrifts, with an average capital ratio of 8%, paid 33 basis points more for their funds, even though the average capital ratio of thrifts outside Texas was only 3.7%. 
At Texas banks, the average premium was 31 basis points. 
The weakest banks paid 47 basis points more for their funds relative to banks outside Texas, while the top quarter of Texas banks, with an average capital ratio of 13.3%, paid 18 basis points more for their funds. 
The average capital ratio for banks outside Texas was 9.7%. 

   These figures suggest that competitive pressures from the state's most troubled financial institutions are requiring the stronger institutions to pay higher interest rates on their deposits to retain adequate funding. 
This process not only weakens the financial condition of the solvent banks and thrifts in Texas, it also penalizes the stronger institutions because of the problems of the most troubled institutions. 

   We share Mr. Smith's position that the current system of federal deposit guarantees needs to be reformed. 
Policies that have removed incentives for depositors to reallocate their deposits from the most troubled financial institutions have also removed a market process that contributes to the overall safety and soundness of the financial system.

   Enron Corp. said it agreed to turn over the operation of its management information systems functions to Electronic Data Systems Corp., a unit of General Motors Corp., as part of a 10-year pact valued at about $750 million. 

   Enron, the nation's largest pipeline operator, has been eliminating jobs and taking other cost-cutting steps. 
But it said that under the pact, EDS will offer employment to the 550 people currently employed at the management information systems division. 
A majority of the workers are based in Houston, about 40 are based in Omaha, Neb., and a few are scattered elsewhere. 

   In addition to maximizing services of the division, the deal will result in substantial savings for Enron. 

   The accord is expected to save debt-laden Enron about $20 million a year over its 10-year term. 
With about $3.87 billion of long-term debt, Enron is in the midst of a three-phase debt-reduction program that includes cutting cash flow from operations, the planned sale of a total of $200 million to $300 million of non-strategic oil and gas properties and the possible sale of 20% of its oil and gas unit. 

   That unit, Enron Oil &amp; Gas Co., is valued at about $2 billion and was put on the block earlier this year. 
But the sale was halted after the company failed to get bids at prices it had expected. 
The company was more successful, however, in the sale of half its cogeneration operations for $104.1 million earlier this year. 
Proceeds from that sale went to reducing debt. 

   EDS, the Dallas-based business information systems arm of GM, said the agreement is the largest contract it has signed other than the business its does with GM, the Detroit-based auto maker. 

   Currently, EDS has a contract with the U.S. Army valued at about $700 million. 
That 10-year pact was signed in 1982.

<HL> OTC Focus: Decline by Intel, Other Computer Issues Depresses Market; Composite Index Falls </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bearishness about Intel and other semiconductor stocks pushed the over-the-counter market lower, in contrast to the slight advances posted by exchange-listed issues. 

   The Nasdaq composite index declined 0.23 to 372.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index both rose. 

   OTC traders said selling in Intel, one of Nasdaq's premier stocks, dragged the market down. 
Intel fell 1 3/4 to 22 on Nasdaq-leading volume of 2.7 million shares. 

   "I thought the market acted all right, except Intel {trading} was sort of a disaster," said Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., New York. 
Among other semiconductor stocks, Integrated Device Technology slipped 1/8 to 11 1/2, and Micron Technology fell 3/4 to 16 5/8. 

   Part of the reason for the semiconductor declines was market rumors about a slowing of demand for Intel's computer chips, including the return of some chips to Intel. 
Analysts disagreed over whether there had actually been any such activity, and late in the day an Intel spokeswoman in Santa Clara, Calif., said: "There are no products being returned to Intel for lack of demand. 
There is no truth to these rumors." 

   The Nasdaq composite index is weighted toward huge stocks such as Intel, which has a market value of about $4 billion, so Intel's fall was a major reason the composite index lagged behind the rest of the market. 

   Yesterday nearly provided a statistical rarity, as Nasdaq volume was almost as high as the New York Stock Exchange's. 
The Big Board, on one of its slowest days of the year, traded only 115.2 million shares; Nasdaq was close behind with 111.9 million. 
However, only 74.6 million of those were traded on the Nasdaq National Market System, where two-thirds of Nasdaq issues, including most of the largest ones, reside. 

   CompuChem rode yesterday's publicity about new drug-testing rules for U.S. transportation workers to a 1988 high of 9, up 3/4. 
More than 195,000 shares changed hands, nearly eight times the stock's average daily volume. 

   The Transportation Department Monday ordered extensive drug-testing requirements for four million transportation workers, including airline pilots, railroad engineers and truck drivers. 
CompuChem, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has a market value of about $28 million and is well-known in the drug-testing field, which accounts for 55% of its business. 

   Interest in the stock yesterday was spurred when analyst Craig Dickson of the brokerage firm Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C., made positive comments about CompuChem to the firm's sales force. 
"The airlines will have to contract with somebody, and they {CompuChem} provide the service," he said. 

   Peter Coolidge, a trader at Kidder Peabody, which said it handled a lot of the CompuChem trading yesterday, said: "It's an attractive idea for retail investors. 
People want to purchase groups that are hot, and this is hot." 

   According to Paul L. Brunswick, CompuChem's chief financial officer, the company has contracts with 32 of the 82 Fortune 500 companies that conduct drug tests. 
It also has contracts with the Federal Aviation Administration and other government agencies, two major airlines and six railroads. 

   "We stand to get more business" from the Transportation Department plan, Mr. Brunswick said. 
"It definitely bodes well for our market environment." 
He wouldn't make specific predictions. 

   Among other active stocks, Japanese issue NEC surged 3 1/8 to 73 1/4, helped by news that Honeywell Bull introduced a mainframe computer based on NEC's Japanese mainframes that is said to be the world's most powerful general-purpose computer. 
NEC owns 15% of Honeywell Bull. 

   Burritt Interfinancial Bancorp jumped 3 1/4 to 18 1/2. 
Centerbank signed a definitive agreement to acquire Burritt for $22 a share. 

   Advance Circuits gained 3/4 to 3 5/8 after the company said it might sell itself. 

   BankAtlantic tumbled 2 1/2 to 10 on a negative earnings report. 
Ponce Federal Bank fell 3/4 to 6 1/8 after it said it may face fines over possible federal charges stemming from currency transactions and that its net income could be materially reduced as a result.

<HL> McCall Pattern Is Put Up for Sale By Coloroll </HL>

   McCall Pattern Co., which in the past four years has been shifted between several owners and recently defaulted on two big debt payments, is up for sale again. 

   U.K.-based Coloroll Group PLC, which currently owns 50% of the home sewing concern, has retained Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. to find a buyer. 
But analysts expect the new price to be well below the $95 million it fetched last time the business changed hands in July 1987. 

   In July this year, the company's net worth fell below the minimum required under a note agreement with Travelers Insurance Co. in connection with a $35 million, 9.75% note issue, and the notes were declared in default. 
Subsequently, McCall failed to make a $3.8 million payment of principal on the notes, which meant it couldn't make any interest payments on a separate $22 million junk-bond issue. 

   Since July 1987, McCall's business, along with the rest of the home sewing industry's, has soured. 
Citing an "overall decline in domestic pattern industry unit sales," it reported a loss of $3.1 million in the six months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $1.2 million a year earlier. 
Sales during the period declined 10% to $28.4 million from $31.7 million. 

   Interest expense for the latest six months nearly doubled, to $4.5 million from $2.5 million a year earlier. 
Cash and marketable securities at June 30 fell to $2.8 million from $10.7 million a year earlier, while accounts receivable doubled to $13.8 million. 
The company noted an increased rate of pattern returns from dealers. 
Its $109.5 million in assets included $57.9 million in goodwill. 

   Its liabilities included $22.2 million in current liabilities, and $68 million in longterm debt. 
The company had a retained earnings deficit of $5.5 million at midyear. 

   McCall, which began in the home-sewing business more than a hundred years ago, was acquired by Norton Simon Inc. in 1968; after Norton Simon was acquired in 1983 by Esmark, McCall was sold the following year for $24.5 million to TLC Pattern Inc., a group controlled by attorney and investor Reginald Lewis, one of the few black investment bankers on Wall Street. 

   In 1987, McCall was sold to an investor group controlled by John Crowther Group PLC, a British textile concern, for $63 million; the group assumed another $32 million in debt, including $22 million in junk bonds sold by Mr. Lewis through Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in 1985. 

   This past June, Crowther itself was acquired by Coloroll Group, another British home-furnishings concern. 
The company currently is named Crowthers McCall Pattern Inc. 
Two entities of a Shearson Lehman Brothers Group Inc. affiliate and Mr. Lewis still hold a small stake in the company, estimated at less than 10%. 

   "Crowthers overpaid for McCall," says Simon Edwards, an analyst for Cobbold Roach Ltd., a London brokerage firm. 
And when Coloroll acquired Crowthers, the debt holders became vulnerable. 
"Coloroll seems to have let go of the debt, hoping that new buyers for the company would be responsible," says Mr. Edwards. 

   But a McCall spokesman points out that the default coincided with the banks' refusal to extend the company's $5 million credit line beyond July 31. 

   The possible sale and the default are seen as yet another example of the vulnerability of junk-bond financing as companies repeatedly change hands while their businesses weaken. 

   When Coloroll acquired Crowthers it decided to concentrate on home furnishings instead of peripheral businesses such as home sewing. 
That decision and McCall's declining business seems to have clinched the decision to put up the sale sign again, a McCall spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   Thanks to Paul Gigot for his Nov. 4 Potomac Watch column ("Incumbent for Life: I Came, I Saw, I Gerrymandered") regarding Rep. George Brown of California. 
I think it goes a long way toward explaining how incumbents in the House of Representatives -- designed to be the most representative of our legislative bodies -- have become the most entrenched. 

   Mr. Gigot describes Mr. Brown issuing campaign material that is highly misleading with respect to both his personal position and his voting record. 
For this misrepresentation to work, however, he must have the cooperation -- active or passive -- of the national and local press. 

   The press -- whether through laziness, bias or nonperformance -- allows a George Brown to run away from his own voting record -- by not independently pointing out the inconsistencies between the record and the statements and implications of his campaign material. (As a longtime Massachusetts resident, I have seen efforts by the Bush campaign to point out Michael Dukakis's record reported in much of the national media as "personal attacks," amplifying the reaction of the Dukakis campaign organization. 
By and large, the Bush charges were true.) 

   The discussion of the importance of political-action committees raises another question. 
When is a bribe a bribe and when is a bribe extortion? 
I get the impression that Rep. Brown's business-PAC contributions are not focused on what he will do for the contributors; rather, I sense they fear what he would do to them if they don't make one.

   Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), a friend of thrifts and a critic of broad securities powers for banks, became the leading candidate to head the key House subcommittee on banking issues. 

   Rep. Annunzio formally announced he is seeking the Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation and Insurance Subcommittee chairmanship. 
In recent years, the panel has shaped most major legislation before it reached the full Banking Committee. 
The subcommittee is "the nerve center of the committee," said one staffer. 

   Lobbyists and Banking Committee staffers said Mr. Annunzio doesn't have any serious opposition. 
They said it was too early to rule out the possibility that another member might mount a challenge to head the prestigious subcommittee. 
But they said he would be hard to beat. 

   The Chicago Democrat said he wants to start early next year to draft a plan to rescue the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Rep. Annunzio would like to arrange a closed meeting with representatives of the regulatory agencies, the thrift industry, other private interests and the Bush administration, said his aide, Curtis Prins. 
"He likes to hold meetings and work everything out," Mr. Prins said. 

   Bank powers bills would be next on his agenda, Rep. Annunzio said yesterday. 
Bankers view him as an impediment; last summer, he voted against granting banks broad new securities underwriting powers. 
But he pledged yesterday to allow subcommittee members to shape their own legislative proposals in small task forces of the panel. 
And Mr. Prins said, "He is not the kind of person to inflict his position over the wishes of the committee." 

   Rep. Annunzio is the only member who has openly bid to head the panel, and he has seniority working for him. 
Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), who is heavily favored to be chairman of the Banking Committee, said in an interview that he wouldn't seek to head its financial institutions panel as well. 

   Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), who was defeated in his bid for re-election to the House, currently holds the chairmanship of both the full committee and the key subcommittee. 
But Mr. Gonzalez said he wasn't sure he would have time to run any subcommittee. 
He expressed interest in continuing as chairman of the Housing and Community Development Subcommittee, but added, "there are only so many things I can do."

<HL> Enterprise: MicroGeneSys Sets Offering, Bucking Investment Trend </HL>

   MicroGeneSys Inc., the tiny biotechnology concern that was first to begin U.S. human trials of a potential vaccine against AIDS, will ask investors to back a long shot in its planned initial offering totaling as much as $31.3 million. 

   If it goes ahead with the offering by year end, as planned, the company will be plunging into a soft overall equities market that has particularly lost its taste for speculative biotech stocks. 
Since last year's market crash, few such companies have considered going to public markets for more funding, and many biotech concerns have seen their share prices shrivel to a fraction of their pre-crash value. 

   The company's lead research product is its experimental vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
MicroGeneSys began its pioneering domestic human testing on the vaccine in 1987, and the trials currently include about 100 subjects. 
To date, the experimental vaccine has been successful in producing antibodies to the AIDS virus, but such an immune reaction doesn't at all guarantee protection against AIDS infection. 
It also is at work on nine other potential vaccines, for such things as tropical diseases and respiratory illness. 

   Creating an anti-AIDS vaccine is considered one of the most technically difficult challenges in modern infectious disease history. 
And MicroGeneSys, in its preliminary prospectus, warned "there can be no assurance" its research will succeed. 
It also pointed out that it will be "at least several years" before it gets regulatory approval for commercial sales of any of its products, assuming they do prove successful. 

   Investors used to skim past such warnings in their rush to get on the biotech bandwagon. 
But they have grown wary, after witnessing the industry grow thick with competitors, some of whom have found the task of translating their bright ideas into commercial products more difficult than they had anticipated. 

   MicroGeneSys said it plans to offer three million shares, and certain shareholders another 130,500 shares, at a price of from $7 to $10 a share. 
The offering would increase its common shares outstanding to 7.7 million. 
Lead underwriter will be Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has in the past been only a minor player in the initial public offering game but has lately been very aggressively bidding to raise capital for new companies. 

   The underwriters will get discounts and commissions of slightly less than 8% of the deal, towards the high end of the customary 6%-8%, but "in this market, that probably is not unreasonable," said one investment banker not associated with the transaction. 

   "I wish them luck," said M. Kathleen Behrens, an analyst with Robertson, Colman &amp; Stephens in San Francisco, who hadn't yet seen the MicroGeneSys preliminary prospectus. 
"This is a tough environment for financing biotech companies through equity financing." 
Ms. Behrens noted that while biotech concerns historically go public at a very early stage, only one such company, NeoRx Inc., has opted to hold an initial offering since the crash. 
"We were co-managers" of the August offering, she said. 
"It wasn't easy."

<HL> Farm Lender's Earnings Surged In Third Period </HL>

<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System's third-quarter results improved sharply, though the nation's largest farm lender continues to use an unusual accounting method to boost profits and remains saddled with a huge load of troubled loans. 

   The farmer-owned system, which received a federal bailout earlier this year, said net income for the third quarter was $98 million, up from $4 million a year earlier. 
Both periods, however, were aided by big reversals of reserves for loan losses -- in effect, reducing the reserve for future problems. 
The reversal was $128 million in the latest period, up from $93 million a year earlier. 

   System officials have defended the practice, saying that improved agricultural conditions justify a lower reserve for losses. 
The practice is rare among lending institutions, however. 

   What's more, much of the improvement in the farm economy -- including a firming of land prices and higher farm income -- has largely been the result of a generous U.S. farm legislation rather than any fundamental strength. 

   System officials said that it is still too early to assess the drought's impact on its borrowers but that the $3.9 billion federal drought relief package would cushion the blow. 

   In the first nine months, Farm Credit profit was $434 million, up from a year-earlier loss of $197 million. 
The reversal of loan-loss reserves for the 1988 period was $469 million, while in the 1987 nine months the system added $11 million to its reserve. 

   The reserve declined to $2.40 billion at Sept. 30 from $2.95 billion at the start of the year. 
Problem loans -- both those on which the system has stopped recording interest and other "high risk" loans -- fell about $2 billion during the last year to $8.82 billion. 

   The firming of farm land prices is evident in the gains the system has recorded on recent sales. 
It had third-quarter profit of $11 million on sale of land it owned through foreclosure or other means, and $46 million in such profits for the first nine months. 
Last year, the system was still losing money when it sold land. 

   Property owned by the system stood at $702 million at Sept. 30, down from $876 million at the beginning of 1988. 

   The third-quarter profit would have been higher, by $81 million, but the system recorded a charge to profits of that amount when it retired some high interest-rate debt.

   Wells Fargo &amp; Co. raised its quarterly cash dividend on common stock 25% to 75 cents a share. 

   The new dividend will be paid Jan. 20, to stock of record Dec. 30. 
Wells Fargo for the past several years has been one of the most profitable of the major banks. 
It has done so by a combination of watching costs closely, and by aggressively selling off troubled foreign loans. 
In the third quarter, Wells Fargo had net income of $131.7 million, or $2.36 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $155 million, or $2.77 a share. 

   For the first nine months of 1988, the bank had profit of $376.6 million, or $6.75 a share. 
That compares with a year-earlier loss of $60.4 million, which was largely the result of a big reserve for troubled foreign loans.

<TEXT>
   Your Oct. 17 article discussing reasons for the rise in litigation ("Litigation Boom? 
Professor Turns Up a New Culprit") referring to Prof. Marc Galanter of the University of Wisconsin School of Law fails to mention the most important reason for increased lawsuit filings. 
It is simply the inescapable fact that the more affluent a society becomes the more focused are rights to property and the protection of those rights. 

   In a free society the right to property, i.e. money, is jealously guarded, as it should be. 
That "right" opens the door to the accumulation of property by an ever-increasing proportion of the population through various means. 
Of course those means are not always apparent, for they may be the enforcement of a right to employment, to receive work-related benefits, or to transfer payments such as welfare from a state or the federal government. 
The only thing worse than being poor is to have no money. 

   Increased expectations of wealth pervade our society, and if a jury perceives a wrong the law will always rise to the occasion and provide a remedy. 
Unfortunately a severely handicapped personal-injury victim cannot be mended by the law; accordingly, the law provides for money as the common denominator to award the victim a substitute for impossible physical rehabilitation. 
Juries apply equitable principles by and large and, they too, rising in personal affluence, increase awards to plaintiffs when the legal tests for recovery have been met. 

   Increased use of federal courts for contract litigation is a direct reflection of our increased affluence, for it is common knowledge federal courts are perceived (not necessarily justifiably) as the forum to file the "big ones" and most plaintiffs and their lawyers would like to think they file big cases.

<TEXT>
   Re Mortimer R. Feinberg's Oct. 24 Manager's Journal article "When to Engender Fear . . . or at Least a High Degree of Anxiety": I worked for J. Edgar Hoover from April 7, 1941, until his death on May 2, 1972 -- first as a special agent and later as a special agent in charge. 
Mr. Feinberg's description of Mr. Hoover as a "world-class fearmonger" is a gross misjudgment of this great man. 

   Over a period of 31 years I profited from Mr. Hoover's skills as an executive and as a manager. 
I received letters of censure when I failed to meet his high standards of performance. 
On the other hand I received letters of commendation when I performed exceptionally well. 
I did not fear Mr. Hoover. 
I admired and respected him. 

   As chairman of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI (262 members), I can say we don't take kindly to Mr. Feinberg's false label of Mr. Hoover as a "world-class fearmonger." 
The nation sorely needs more men of his exceptional executive ability today. 
He established the FBI on high standards of performance, dedication to duty and discipline. 
Discipline, not fear, was the driving force of Mr. Hoover's leadership. 
We willingly accepted these principles and still feel that it was a privilege to have worked under his leadership.

   Interest rates on certificates of deposit offered by leading broker-dealers jumped almost a third of a point, responding to the huge jump in rates on short-term U.S. Treasury issues this week. 

   Major banks didn't follow suit, but Norberto Mehl, publisher of Banxquote Money Markets, a New York-based information service, said the banks will be forced to boost yields on consumer CDs as much as a quarter of a point in the next few weeks, if high Treasury bill rates and the weak dollar continue. 

   When such conditions change, broker-dealers, who sell CDs with yields based primarily on the rates of short-term U.S. Treasury bills, respond quicker than banks, which constantly have to match assets with liabilities, Mr. Mehl said. 

   Another interest-rate analyst said, "The general consensus is that interest rates will continue to go up." 
He speculates that the Federal Reserve is delaying a planned increase in the discount rate until the foreign-exchange and bond markets stabilize a bit. 

   At the U.S. Treasury's weekly auction of short-term bills on Monday, interest rates jumped to their highest level since April 1985. 
The new three-month bill rose to 7.82% from 7.54% at the previous Monday's auction, while the six-month issues climbed to 7.87% from 7.71%. 
The two-week rise in the bill rate hasn't translated into significantly higher yields on bank savings CDs yet, but the larger denomination CDs, or jumbo certificates, continue to respond strongly. 

   Average jumbo bank CDs were up more than 10 basis points, or 1/10 of a point, for most maturities. 
The one-year, for example, rose to 8.23%, from 8.11%. 
Last week the jumbos also posted strong gains. 

   Banxquote said the average yield for 30-day retail CDs offered by leading banks rose to 6.51% yesterday, from 6.47% the previous week. 

   The average six-month CD rose four basis points to 7.75% yesterday, while the average one-year CD yield was up five basis points to 8.03%. 
Longer term, the two-year and five-year CD yields rose three basis points, to 8.16% and 8.52%, respectively. 

   Broker-dealers were offering three-month CDs with a 8.45% yield, an increase from 8.10%, the previous week. 
Banxquote attributed part of that jump to a cash rebate program offered by one broker-dealer, which it didn't name. 
The average six-month issue from a broker-dealer was at 8.46%, up from 8.15%. 
The one-year CD was at 8.57%, up 30 basis points from last week. 
Two-year CDs sold by broker-dealers were at 8.71%, up from 8.52%, and the five-year CD rose to 8.87% from 8.78% last week. 

   The average yield for money-market accounts, which have been rising one or two basis points a week since early July, grew slightly to 6.31% from 6.30%, according to Banxquote.

   Ronald Bergwerk (letters to the editor, "Soviet Georgia Still Reveres Joseph Stalin," Oct. 11) laments the closing of the Stalin Museum in Gori. 
I concur. 

   Two years ago I visited Tbilisi with a group of scholars and journalists. 
We persuaded our highly reluctant Intourist guide to take a side trip to see the Stalin Museum. 
The visit was revealing. 
The official museum guide was strongly pro-Stalin and in translating her honorific references to him, our regular guide toned down her rhetoric. 

   More revealing was the portrayal of the 1930s with the genocide of millions of Ukrainian peasants. 
I had been tipped off by a U.S. official in Leningrad to observe how this reign of terror was presented. 
The whole period was covered by one large blown-up photograph of a pretty, blond, smiling girl driving a tractor. 
Other shorter periods in Stalin's career were elaborately illustrated with adulatory words, photographs and documents. 

   In his efforts to encourage candor about Stalin's crimes, Mikhail Gorbachev will have to deal with a tenacious, selective amnesia.

<HL> Inside Track: Citicorp Chief Puts His Money Where His Mouth Is </HL>

   John S. Reed, chairman and chief executive officer of Citicorp, has been saying lately that Latin American loans won't drag big-bank earnings through the mud. 
Last month, he put $2.5 million of his own money where his mouth is. 

   Mr. Reed bought 100,000 shares of Citicorp on the open market, mostly at $25 a share, on Oct. 19. 
The action was unusual for the Citicorp chief, who usually acquires his shares by exercising options or through company stock-accumulation plans. 
He owns 402,988 shares in all. 

   The open-market purchase was seen as a strong expression of confidence, especially because Mr. Reed has options to acquire 258,424 shares. 
The fact that he didn't choose to wait and possibly exercise those options later cheered banking analysts. 

   Mr. Reed's options have an average exercise price of $26.12, according to Citicorp's 1988 proxy statement. 
The stock closed yesterday at $24.75, down 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   "I'm always glad to hear it" when insiders buy, said Joan Goodman, a banking analyst with Pershing &amp; Co. 
"I think they feel secure that the stock is going to go up, or they wouldn't buy it." 

   Ms. Goodman, who has already rated Citicorp stock a buy, said it's "becoming a much stronger bank." 
She cited its "technological base," including "one of the most sophisticated money transfer systems in the world" and the Quotron network of securities-information display terminals used by many brokers. 

   In addition, she said, the nation's largest banking concern is "going to get an earnings blast in the fourth quarter" because Brazil has resumed interest payments on its foreign loans after getting an infusion of new loans. 

   But Ms. Goodman said her main reasons for recommending Citicorp shares are that they are cheap and have a generous dividend yield of 5.9%. 
"Where else can you get a stock that's going for a 5.3 price-earnings ratio?" she said. 
She expects Citicorp to earn $4.45 a share this year and $4.75 a share next year. 

   Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., has lower earnings estimates ($4.10 a share this year, $4.50 a share next year) and rates the stock a "hold." 
But he said yesterday, "I think John {Reed} has plenty of grounds to be optimistic. 
If he turns out to be right on LDC {less developed country} debt, then Citicorp stock is undervalued. 
And I assume John has the courage of his convictions." 

   Mr. Soifer said he rates Citicorp a hold because "we're less optimistic about the long-term outlook for these countries than John Reed has been publicly." 
Mr. Soifer believes Citicorp is less at risk from Latin debt problems than Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp. or BankAmerica Corp., but he prefers Bankers Trust New York Corp., which he views as fairly well insulated from the Latin debt problem. 

   Robert Gabele, president of Investnet Group Inc., which runs a data bank on insider trades, said big banks have been one of the few pockets of strength for insider buying this year. 
"It's the only group where we've seen much accumulation this year." he said. 
He also was intrigued by the way Mr. Reed acquired his new shares. 
"If we see a guy who traditionally exercises options buy on the open market, that's extra bullish," he said. 

   Mr. Reed was traveling and couldn't be reached. 
Citicorp declined to comment.

   NEXT YEAR IS NOW: Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., chairman of Coastal Corp., sold 200,000 shares of the Houston-based pipeline company this summer and another 200,000 last month, realizing $12.1 million in all. 
The sales, the 64-year-old chief executive said, were for estate planning reasons. 
"I have to plan on dying every day because I fly on planes every day," he said. 

   "I sold 200,000 shares last year. 
My estate planners wanted me to sell 200,000 this year and 200,000 next year," Mr. Wyatt said. 
But he decided to do next year's selling early for fear that George Bush would be unable to prevent a tax increase in 1989. 

   "This is all {the stock selling} I plan to do for five or six years," Mr. Wyatt said. 
"Whenever the real estate market gets straightened out, I plan on selling some real estate." 

   He still directly owns 2.3 million common shares of Coastal, worth about $71 million at yesterday's closing price of $31.125 on the Big Board.

   COMFORTABLE SLIPPERS: At R.G. Barry Corp., a Pickerington, Ohio, slipper manufacturer traded on the American Stock Exchange, four insiders have purchased shares recently. 

   The biggest buyer was Richard W. Zborowski, vice president, human resources, who spent $58,500 to buy 13,000 shares last month at $4.50 a share. 
"We're excited about our new products," he said yesterday, referring mainly to some new styles of women's slippers. 
And he felt the stock price was "down pretty low." 

   All four insiders bought last month at prices under $5 a share, less than half the early 1987 price of $10. 
The company has said that 1988 earnings won't equal the 74 cents a share achieved in 1987. 
But the company is building two more plants, and a spokesman said demand for the concern's slippers is running ahead of supply.

   BURNS SELLS, LEAVES: The sales at Robert Half International Inc. reflect a change of control. 
Two insiders, including former Chairman Brian P. Burns, each agreed to sell 1.6 million shares to Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, a closely held investment firm that's seeking a 42% stake in Robert Half. 
Mr. Burns resigned Nov. 2.

   A lot of small-business owners think income taxes are going up, no matter what George Bush pledged in his presidential campaign. 

   In a national survey of small-business chief executives taken prior to the Nov. 8 election, 57% of some 21,000 respondents said they expected corporate income taxes to increase if the Republicans won the White House. 
Results of the survey were released yesterday by the accounting firm Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. 

   Asked if personal income taxes would increase in a Bush administration, 52% said yes. 

   More than 90% of those polled said taxes would go up had Michael Dukakis won the election. 
Small-business executives "live in the real world," said John Cherin, an Arthur Andersen partner. 
"Raising taxes, regardless of who is in office, is what they see." 

   Those surveyed favored Mr. Bush in the race by an eight-to-one margin. 

   On other matters, two-thirds of the executives said their 1989 sales would run at least 5% ahead of 1988 levels. 
Two-thirds also said they expected inflation in 1988 to average 5% to 6%, a modest increase over the current 4.5% annual rate.

   The Reagan administration is preparing a budget that will ignore many of President-elect George Bush's campaign promises by proposing an increase in defense spending of 2% after inflation and deep cuts in domestic spending. 

   The Reagan budget will become the starting point for Mr. Bush's negotiations with Congress. 
It will allow him to appear, in his own words, "a kinder, gentler" president by offering to trim the Reagan defense proposal and spend more on his domestic priorities, such as education. 

   The White House clearly is drafting the fiscal 1990 budget, which is due Jan. 9, with President Reagan's legacy in mind, not President-elect Bush's campaign promises. 
"This is Ronald Reagan's last budget, not George Bush's first budget," said Barbara Clay, spokeswoman for the White House budget office. 

   The budget will agree with some of Mr. Bush's campaign pledges. 
President Reagan won't tinker with Social Security or propose tax increases, administration officials say. 

   As a result, the White House will have to submit a budget with big cuts in domestic programs in order to meet the requirements of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
Preliminary estimates by the White House budget office project the fiscal 1990 deficit at $132 billion if current policies aren't changed. 
The Gramm-Rudman law requires the president's budget show a deficit of no more than $100 billion. 

   The White House "will have to leave no stone unturned," said one administration official. 
The official added, "They will have to repropose everything," that is, offer anew most of the spending cuts that President Reagan has proposed unsuccessfully in the past. 

   Just yesterday, White House budget director Joseph Wright and his staff weighed proposals designed to slow the increase in Medicare costs. 
Without some change, the health-insurance program for the elderly will cost the federal government $97.7 billion in fiscal 1990, up $12.3 billion, or 14.5%, from the current fiscal year, the budget office estimates. 

   Another costly issue that budget officials are currently discussing is just how much the federal government will have to spend next year to bail out troubled thrifts. 
Regulators have repeatedly revised their estimates -- and always upward. 

   Congressional Republicans expect Mr. Bush to submit a revised budget in late February or early March, although there isn't any formal requirement that he do so. 
Some Bush aides have suggested that Mr. Bush might skip this step and instead attempt to fashion a compromise budget with congressional leaders. 

   If President-elect Bush and Congress fail to find a way to reduce the deficit substantially, the Gramm-Rudman law requires across-the-board spending cuts, known as a sequester, next fall in order to bring the fiscal 1990 deficit to $100 billion. 

   "I think sequester is a possibility, and one that should not be lightly dismissed," a Republican congressional staffer said. 
He noted that the automatic spending cuts that would be imposed under Gramm-Rudman disproportionately affect the Pentagon, which might not disappoint the Democrats who control Congress. 

   "A $30-billion sequester -- $15 billion from defense and $15 billion from non-defense programs -- might appear to some as the lesser evil when compared with $30 billion in cuts coming entirely out of the domestic budget," he said.

<HL> Enterprise: Eased Homework Rules to Exert Little Effect on Apparel Makers </HL>

<TEXT>
   Apparel makers don't plan significant changes in operations following the U.S. Labor Department's decision last week to allow certain companies to hire employees who work at home. 

   Already, most companies affected -- makers of gloves, jewelry, embroidering, buttons and buckles -- have moved much of their production outside the U.S., where skilled labor is cheaper and more available. 
Some companies with U.S. manufacturing operations say they prefer using factory workers or simply have to because of union contracts. 
In addition, registration and record-keeping procedures required by the new rule, effective in January, are likely to discourage some companies from using home-workers. 

   Among the estimated 880,000 workers in apparel-related manufacturing, industry experts say from 8,000 to 125,000 people do contract work at home. 
That includes illegal workers and those who supplement factories by doing part-time sewing. 

   Industry experts don't expect much, if any, increase. 
The main impact of the new rules, says a Labor Department spokesman, is that companies using home-workers illegally "now have a chance to be legitimate employers." 

   Some won't be affected at all. 
"I don't see any need for {home-workers} in the near future," says John Papa, an owner of Mario Papa &amp; Sons Inc., a Gloversville, N.Y., glove maker that does mostly defense contract work. 
Mario Papa employs about 200 factory workers. 

   Companies already under regulatory scrutiny for using home-workers illegally say they don't necessarily plan to resume the practice. 
Earlier this year, Bordeaux Apparel Inc. in Clarinda, Iowa, stopped using home-workers to sew appliques on leisure wear and now uses 15 factory workers. 
Bordeaux, involved in litigation with the government over prior use of home-workers, says it hasn't decided whether to hire home-workers again. 

   Michael Avakian of the Center on National Labor Policy, a nonprofit legal group that represents workers in labor matters, says of homework: "We are talking about small pockets of people. . . . 
There are no large economies of scale, no big profits to be made off home-workers." 

   There are manufacturers that welcome the chance to use part-time home-workers. 
Some jewelry makers would like to use home-workers for handwork and bead stringing. 
Austern &amp; Paul Inc. a Providence, R.I., jewelry maker with 120 union workers, hopes to add nonunion home-workers. 
Now, the company uses costly, independent contractors at peak periods, says company President Alvin Orgel. 

   Where home-workers have worked legally, the practice hasn't caught on heavily. 
Most factories use home-workers as part-timers to supplement core operations. 
Moreover, there isn't a steady supply of skilled home-workers. 

   In Gloversville, once the heart of America's glove industry, the state has let the few concerns still there use home-workers. 
Rubin Gloves Inc., has about 60 union factory workers and 10 nonunion home-workers. 
But with skilled workers scarce, Rubin is hard pressed to add more, says Everett Weber, president. 

   In 1984, the Labor Department set up a voluntary certification program to allow knitted-outerwear makers to hire home-workers. 
But union contracts at such companies as Philadelphia's London Knitting Co., which has 80 union sewers who make men's sweaters, thwarted knitwear concerns from using home-workers. 
About 80 knitwear firms, a relatively small number, have registered with the department. 

   Unions say homework jeopardizes workers' rights and makes it impossible to enforce regulations in working conditions, minimum wages and overtime pay. 
The International Ladies Garment Workers Union has said it plans to challenge the new rule in court. 
The Labor Department says nearly half the knitwear companies that registered to use home-workers were cited for violations, mainly regarding records. 

   Regulators say such violations tend to decline after inspections, but union critics insist it is hard to regulate home-workers. 
Moreover, unions say extending homework to such fringe areas as glove making will pave the way for home-workers in basic industries like women's apparel.

<HL> Grand Met Threatens to Lower Its Offer For Pillsbury, Citing Burger King Plan </HL>
<AUTHOR> Richard Gibson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> PSY U.GME </CO>
<IN> TNM FOD RFD DIV </IN>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, now supported by nearly 80% of Pillsbury Co.'s shareholders, threatened to lower its takeover bid if Pillsbury's planned spinoff of its Burger King Corp. unit occurs. 

   Attorneys for Grand Met told a Delaware court that the British concern would be "required to make fundamental changes to its ($60-a-share) offer" should the spinoff occur first. 
Among the changes would be a lower price to reflect a potential tax liability of several hundred million dollars. 

   Moreover, since Burger King would become a Florida corporation, Grand Met would have to mount additional legal attacks on Florida's anti-takeover laws should it still want to acquire the fast-food chain, its attorneys warned. 

   Pillsbury stock eased on the news, closing at $58, down 62.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. 

   "The spinoff will make it substantially less likely that Grand Met will ever successfully acquire the entire Pillsbury company," Grand Met's attorneys said in a letter to the Delaware Chancery Court, which is reconsidering the validity of Pillsbury's pill. 
The pill is designed to discourage Grand Met from buying tendered shares, since to do so would balloon the price. 

   Grand Met also sought to tighten its squeeze on Pillsbury by extending its takeover offer only four more days. 
The offer is now set to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday. 
"You just want to put the pressure on," said a Grand Met attorney when asked about the brevity of the extension. 

   The extension, the shortest of three Grand Met has made since launching its surprise $5.23 billion bid on Oct. 4, comes during a week of legal maneuvering over Pillsbury's poison pill. 

   In a letter to the Delaware court, Grand Met's attorneys characterized the Burger King spinoff proposal as "a poison tax" designed to kill any deal. 
The spinoff, in the form of a stock dividend to Pillsbury shareholders, is scheduled to occur Dec. 2. 
While the spinoff is structured to be tax-free for current Pillsbury holders, it would create a huge tax liability for any third party who bought Pillsbury after Dec. 2. 

   Attorneys for Pillsbury shareholders urged the court to set a hearing on motions to extend that date. 
The holders say they needed more time, partly because they don't have detailed information yet on the spinoff's tax consequences. 

   Grand Met's letter describes the spinoff plan as "another time bomb, planted by Pillsbury's management, to deter the acquisition of the company by Grand Met or any other party." 

   Some arbitragers suggested that Grand Met is betting that the Delaware court will rule this week in another poison pill case that could bear directly on Pillsbury. 
In the other case, attorneys for Interco Inc. are appealing a decision neutralizing its pill defense against a hostile takeover by the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C. 

   Should the court reaffirm its ruling against Interco, the scenario goes, Pillsbury would be under increasing pressure to bargain with Grand Met. 

   Since Grand Met's offer is now set to expire after business on Friday, the company wouldn't have to announce another extension until Monday, giving it the weekend to negotiate a deal. 

   Pillsbury shareholders are growing increasingly impatient. 
Last week, Grand Met said 74.3% of Pillsbury's shares had been tendered. 
Yesterday the British distiller, gambling and franchise concern said the total had risen to 79.1%.

<HL> International: Luxembourg Expects to Stay Tax Haven As EC Prepares to Ease Flow of Capital </HL>
<AUTHOR> Linda Bernier (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> EUROP TAXES </CO>
<IN> BNK </IN>

<TEXT>
   Last December, the bankers association of Luxembourg urged members to stop boasting about the grand duchy's strict bank-secrecy laws and tax advantages. 

   The banks took the warning to heart and shut up. 
For years, they had advertised Luxembourg as a fiscal paradise, which many Europeans saw as a refuge from tax collectors elsewhere in the 12-nation European Community. 
But with the approach of the EC's 1990 deadline for ending most controls on the flow of capital, they feared that appealing to tax avoiders might prompt the EC to draw up European-wide banking rules that would erase Luxembourg's special status. 

   If that happened, the tiny country, wedged between France and Germany on Belgium's southern border, could be hard hit. 
With just 400,000 inhabitants in the heart of a trading bloc of more than 300 million people, it depends on the financial sector for 15% of its economy. 

   The banks have reason to worry. 
France, Denmark and the Netherlands are pushing for measures that would protect them against a flight of capital after 1990. 
Moreover, Luxembourg's image as a European financial center, ranking third after London and Zurich, has been tarnished by allegations linking subsidiaries of the local Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International Holdings S.A. to a huge scheme of laundering money for drug traffickers. 

   For all that, Luxembourg's standing as a banking haven inside the EC probably isn't threatened. 
Even if new EC restrictions emerge, the overall liberalization of capital flows probably will give banking here yet another boost. 
Private banking, which caters to wealthy individuals and has grown rapidly in the past decade, seems certain to expand even more. 

   Eleven banks opened here this year, more than at any time in a decade; more are expected. 
Newcomers include the first British banks to open locally, Lloyds Bank PLC and the TSB Group, both with private-banking operations. 
Barclays Bank may soon join them. 

   The main reasons for the influx are precisely those attractions that Luxembourg doesn't want to discuss: Tax breaks and tight secrecy, which are expected to survive any new EC regulations. 
"Among all the EC countries, Luxembourg still has the attributes of an offshore banking center. . . . 
They'll probably have to modify their position somewhat, but it will still be advantageous compared to other EC countries," says Michael Fornara, senior marketing manager at Lloyds's international private-banking headquarters in Geneva. 

   Aside from low or nonexistent withholding taxes and income taxes on most interest and dividend income, Luxembourg imposes no taxes on securities transactions and sets no minimum reserves for foreign banks, provided they meet reserve regulations in their home countries. 
It also was one of the first countries to let banks write off generous provisions for sovereign debt, thus cutting their tax bills. 

   To be sure, not all Luxembourg's advantages will remain untouched. 
EC finance ministers agreed in June, when they decided to free capital flows, to take measures by mid-1989 to discourage tax fraud and extensive capital flight. 
The ministers soon will consider adopting a standard EC withholding tax on fixed interest income, along with rules requiring EC banks to report interest income to their depositors' national tax authorities. 

   Still, it is doubtful new EC rules will have much impact on Luxembourg. 
An EC Commission official says a withholding tax of perhaps 10% is the measure most likely to be adopted. 
But interest on savings deposits and dividends may be excluded. 
Some experts doubt that such a levy would drive many depositors to far-away havens such as Bermuda or Bahrain. 

   Moreover, a commission official says it is highly unlikely ministers will reach the unanimous agreement needed to restrict bank secrecy. 
"I don't think we will make any major concession on tax advantages or secrecy," says Paul Mousel, a Luxembourg lawyer and tax specialist. 
"It's a question of survival." 

   If many Luxembourg financial attractions were abolished, argue Luxembourg banking and government officials, deposits would leave the EC. 
"If such a change did happen we would just advise our clients to retreat to Switzerland," warns Mr. Fornara of Lloyds. 

   Luxembourg's financial market took off in the 1960s with the emergence of the Eurobond market as German, Scandinavian and other outside banks rushed in to take advantage of its liberal tax policies and easy banking regulations. 
At first, it served as a Eurobond processing center; more recently, foreign banks have moved strongly into private banking. 
The number of banks in the grand duchy has increased to 137 from 15 in 1960. 

   Ten years ago, more than 90% of Luxembourg banks' income came from interest on Eurocredits; today that's down to 60%, with the remaining 40% derived from fees and commissions on private-banking and investment-fund operations. 
More and more small investors are putting their money here. 
While Swiss banks generally deal only with large portfolios, often $1 million or more, Luxembourg bankers are happy to greet Europe's middle-class investors, who may average closer to $200,000. 
And Luxembourg's banking fees and commissions are about a third cheaper than Switzerland's. 

   If too much European capital finds its way to Luxembourg after 1990, provoking exchange-rate imbalances or draining tax revenues from other capitals, the EC could react. 
It might, for example, impose selective exchange controls permitted by the EC directive on free capital movement. 

   For now, though, international banks and Luxembourg authorities expect a bright future. 
"If we succeed we will become the financial center in Europe," and for corporate holdings, "perhaps the Delaware of the EC," says a hopeful Mr. Mousel, the tax specialist.

<HL> Technology: Du Pont Co. to Sell Gene-Spliced Mice For Cancer Studies </HL>

<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. said it plans to begin marketing genetically engineered mice with a high susceptibility to cancer. 

   The mice, developed by scientists at Harvard University, will be sold starting next year to researchers in nonprofit academic and government laboratories who are studying the causes of and treatments for cancer. 
Longer range, Du Pont said it sees a "significant" market for the mice in sales to pharmaceutical and chemical concerns that want to screen potentially carcinogenic products. 

   Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., is a major sponsor of the research that led to the development of the so-called transgenic mouse. 
The company owns exclusive rights to the technology. 
According to the U.S. Patent Office, the mouse is the first genetically altered animal to be sold commercially. 
The only patent for such animals issued by the office is for the Harvard-Du Pont invention, though 30 other applications are currently pending, said a spokesman for the office. 

   Du Pont declined to predict the size of the eventual market for the mice. 
Each animal will sell for less than $50, about the same price as other specially bred mice, a spokesman said. 
Du Pont will take orders for the mice, but they will be produced by a commercial breeder, he said. 

   The advantage of the mice is that they are predisposed to get cancer as a result of the implantation of cancer genes during the embryonic stage of development. 
The mice can be used to test whether small amounts of substances are carcinogenic or whether new cancer treatments are effective. 
Scientists believe they will be helpful in leading to better cancer diagnosis, therapy and prevention. 

   The mice generated considerable controversy earlier this year when they were patented. 
Critics fear broad consequences stemming from abuses of such genetic engineering. 
They are particularly concerned, for example, about current research to develop mice that carry the AIDS virus. 
The fear is that such mice could escape from the laboratories and spread the virus. 

   Du Pont and others, however, have defended the technology as providing an important tool for research. 
Until now, such mice have been available only to researchers who could develop them in their own laboratories. 
The Du Pont mice will be offered first to academic researchers because they have the greatest need for the animals, Du Pont said.

<HL> Retailers Post Mixed Results For the Quarter --- Penney's Profit Fell, but Net Rose for Dayton Hudson And Carter Hawley Hale ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>

<TEXT>
   Three major retailers -- J.C. Penney Co., Dayton Hudson Corp. and Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. -- posted mixed results for their latest quarters, though they expressed optimism about the all-important holiday season ahead. 
Analysts are expecting sales increases for the season of a modest 6% to 7%, or only 2% to 3% above inflation. 

   J.C. Penney said net income fell 6.7% for the third quarter, but it expressed optimism about the holiday quarter because its inventories are relatively slim and an October promotion brought a rush of shoppers to its stores. 

   The Dallas-based retailer said it earned $160 million, or $1.17 a share, for the quarter, down from $171 million, or $1.14 a share, last year. 
Sales fell about 4%, to $3.61 billion from $3.76 billion. 

   The lower inventory levels should keep the company's markdowns in check and improve its margins during the holiday selling season, Penney said. 
In addition, the fourth quarter will benefit from a promotion allowing credit card customers to receive a 25% discount on purchases for one day during the latter half of October. 

   Penney also said it completed a 20 million-share buy-back authorized in 1987, paying $932 million, or $46.61 a share, for its stock. 
It has also purchased 3.6 million shares for $180 million as part of a 15 million-share buy-back authorized this year. 

   For the nine months, Penney said its net income rose 13%, to $372 million, or $2.74 a share, from $328 million, or $2.18 a share. 
The year-ago results included an $82 million charge to relocate the corporate headquarters to Dallas from New York. 
Sales for the period dropped about 4%, to $10 billion from $10.34 billion. 

   Dayton Hudson's third-quarter profit surged 36%, reflecting improved results at its Mervyn's chain. 
The big retailer also said it plans to invest more than $700 million next year to open 72 new stores. 

   Minneapolis-based Dayton's net income for the quarter was $45.6 million, or 54 cents a share, up from $33.6 million, or 34 cents a share, a year ago. 
Per-share results rose more rapidly because shares outstanding fell to 83.8 million from 97.8 million because of a big stock buy-back plan. 

   Revenue for the quarter rose 13% to $2.87 billion from $2.54 billion a year ago. 
However, most of the gains came from new-store openings, as so-called same store sales rose only 2%. 

   Much of the quarter's improvement was at Mervyn's, where sales were up and Dayton didn't have to mark down prices of inventory as much as in past quarters. 

   Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement that he expects "a good holiday season and fourth quarter," though the company wouldn't elaborate. 

   Profit for the first nine months rose about 11% to $104.9 million, or $1.24 a share, from $94.7 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue was up 16% to $8.10 billion from $7 billion a year earlier, though same store sales rose only 2%. 

   For its fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 29, Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale posted net income of $11.3 million, or 52 cents a share, up from $10.7 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 4.3% to $636.7 million from $610.6 million, and comparable store sales rose 3.4% for the quarter. 

   The department-store company posted a loss of about $4 million from operations before an after-tax credit of $15.3 million from the adoption of a change in accounting for income taxes. 
This was mainly due to an $8.8 million increase in interest expense in the latest quarter because average debt outstanding in the year-ago period didn't reflect a full quarter as a restructured company. 

   The year-earlier quarter resulted in a profit from operations of $625,000 before an after-tax gain of $10.1 million from a change in financial accounting for capitalization of certain inventory costs. 

   Carter Hawley Hale said sales improved in the quarter, though women's apparel was "somewhat" slow. 
"Women's apparel isn't matching the performance of our other businesses," the company said. 
The company said inventories are "on plan" going into the holiday quarter.

<HL> Technology: Loss of Combustion Engineering Inc. Expands Greatly </HL>

<TEXT>
   Corrosion problems at Combustion Engineering Inc.'s waste-to-energy plants forced the company to restate its third-quarter results, more than doubling its pretax charge to $165 million and causing a widening in its net loss to $91.7 million from $28.5 million. 

   The engineering concern's key problem occurred at its Hartford, Conn., waste-to-energy plant. 
The walls of the plant's boiler were found to have corroded at the point where a large volume of fresh air is introduced to reduce emissions from the burning process. 

   Richard DeVane, president of the company's fossil systems business, said it appears that oxygen in the fresh air combined with either sulfur, zinc or chloride to produce an oxide that ate away the boiler wall's iron-oxide protective coating. 
Mr. DeVane said Combustion is fixing the problem by adding a high nickel overlay from the top to the bottom of the boiler. 
He added that modifications are being made to two similar plants under construction in Detroit and in Honolulu. 

   Combustion posted the $28.5 million loss last month, including an $80 million pretax charge that reflected costs for completing waste-to-energy plants and certain other projects. 
At the time, it posted nine-month net income of $312,000, or one cent a share. 
But with yesterday's restatement, it posted a nine-month loss of $62.9 million. 

   In the year-earlier quarter, profit was $15.3 million, or 40 cents a share. 
For the nine months, net was $39 million, or $1.07 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Combustion closed at $27.50, down 12.5 cents. 

   Combustion, based in Stamford, Conn., said it also experienced problems at its plants that burn anthracite coal to make electricity, Mr. DeVane said. 
Specifically, the company had to redesign the plants' boiler system to make it bigger. 
The bigger boiler was needed to burn enough coal to obtain the steam temperature and pressure needed to turn a turbine fast enough to generate the required amount of electricity. 

   The anthracite-burning plants had other problems, Mr. DeVane indicated, including the crushers and the ash-handling system. 
But Mr. DeVane added that all such problems have been solved.

<HL> Technology: Cray Discloses That Group Is Studying Building Vastly Larger Supercomputers </HL>

   Cray Research Inc. disclosed that an internal group is studying the possibility of building a new generation of supercomputers vastly more complex than the machines now on the company's drawing board. 

   In Cray's first news conference in seven years, held in conjunction with a supercomputer conference here, Chairman John A. Rollwagen disclosed that a small group at the leading supercomputer maker is exploring the possibility of using hundreds of processors, or small computers, in a new design approach. 
The Cray 3, scheduled for introduction next year, will have 16 processors, while the Cray 4, due in 1991, would have 64. 

   But Mr. Rollwagen quickly qualified his statement, adding that "there are a lot of people looking at (supercomputers with huge arrays of processors) and we like to do things people aren't doing." 

   Company founder Seymour Cray, who now is an outside consultant and Cray's primary computer designer, seemed to further qualify Mr. Rollwagen's statement when he said in an interview following the news conference that "he (Mr. 
Rollwagen) was a little premature. 
We don't have a serious effort. 
We're just trying to understand where other people are. 
I don't think Cray belongs" in the competition for computers with hundreds of processors. 

   While other computer makers, including Control Data Corp.'s ETA Systems Inc., have said in the past that they are exploring the possibility of building highly powerful supercomputers with hundreds of processors, Cray has been mostly silent on the matter. 
Gary P. Smaby, an analyst with Needham &amp; Co., said yesterday's statement was Cray's first disclosure of its internal group. 

   The company also said there has been very strong early interest in its latest and most powerful supercomputer, a $20 million machine called the Y-MP. 
Mr. Rollwagen said Cray has already received six orders for Y-MP machines to be delivered in 1989. 
He added that the company, which had earlier indicated that it might sell about a dozen machines next year, now expects to do better than that, though he wasn't specific. 
"There's been a tremendous interest in that machine," he said. 
"We're excited about it, really thrilled." 

   The Y-MP is the first Cray to use eight central processors; Cray's largest previous models used four. 
Multiprocessor machines can break a complicated problem into pieces and send them to separate processors, drastically reducing solution time. 
Such an ability to do many calculations simultaneously makes three-dimensional modeling during the designing of airplanes, cars and other products much more sophisticated and will perhaps lead to safer designs. 

   The company said the number of units it makes and delivers will rise in 1989, as will the "average system value." 
But revenue and earnings won't totally reflect the increased volume of activity because more machines will be leased than in the past, Mr. Rollwagen said. 
Leasing defers more of the profit from filled orders to the future, he said. 

   Mr. Rollwagen explained that it wasn't a matter of economics. 
Instead, he said, customers want to remain flexible in a period of great technological change. 
"It pays for customers to keep their powder dry," he said. 

   The computer Cray is readying for introduction next, the Cray 3, is plagued by a supply shortage of gallium arsenide, Mr. Cray said. 
The substance is used in the ultrafast chip the machine employs. 
The problem must be overcome if Cray is to make enough machines to meet expected demand. 

   The Cray 3 manufacturing process is novel for Cray, as well. 
For instance, because the machine's components are so small, robots will be used to assemble the computers. 
Mr. Cray said it might be necessary to make the first machines by hand until the robots are working smoothly. 

   Mr. Rollwagen said that for the first time, Cray expects next year to spend more research and development dollars on software than on hardware. 
He said the company traditionally emphasizes hardware development, but it believes that significant gains in computing performance can now come as much from software breakthroughs as from hardware.

<HL> Bush Asks Brady to Remain at Treasury, Indicates Major Role for Him on Budget </HL>

<SO> </SO>

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush asked Nicholas Brady to remain as Treasury secretary, and he indicated the former investment banker and U.S. senator will play a prominent role in budget negotiations with Congress. 

   "His experience in the Senate brings him the valuable ability to work effectively with the Congress as we develop a budget deficit reduction plan," said Mr. Bush. 
"He knows that we have got to sit down with Congress and hammer out a budget deficit agreement, and we have to do it soon." 

   Budget policy is traditionally handled by the White House budget office. 
But Mr. Brady has shown an unusual interest in budget issues since taking office two months ago. 
He has had his staff brief him on the budget and budget process. 
And yesterday, he even attended a review of health-budget issues held by Joseph Wright, the current budget director. 

   Mr. Brady, who will be the new administration's chief economic official, is a close friend of President-elect Bush. 
He is known as a pragmatist, without strong ideological leanings. 
Besides working on budget issues, he is looking for innovative approaches to nagging economic problems, such as the savings-and-loan crisis, Third World debt and the federal budget deficit. 

   Aides say Mr. Brady also has shown an interest in government measures that would make corporate managers focus less on short-term profits and more on the longterm health of their companies. 
One idea being discussed at the Treasury is a "sliding-scale" capital-gains tax break that would provide larger benefits to people who hold stocks for a long time. 

   Mr. Brady is also known to be interested in finding a way to broaden the current U.S.-Third World debt strategy, which he inherited from James Baker, his predecessor at the Treasury and Mr. Bush's secretary of state-designate. 
In particular, it's understood he would like to find a way to encourage more actual reduction of existing foreign debt, rather than focusing as heavily as the Baker plan does on seeking new loans for debtor nations. 
The Baker plan blesses some forms of limited, voluntary debt reduction, but the Brady team is likely to place greater emphasis on that goal. 

   Nevertheless, Mr. Brady, like Mr. Baker, opposes sweeping debt-reduction schemes that would involve transferring private bank risks to taxpayers or requiring banks to write down debt. 
And he is likely to fight any effort by Latin governments for U.S. government-ordered debt relief. 

   Mr. Brady faces the immediate tasks of bringing calm to international currency markets and trying to stabilize the falling dollar. 
His reappointment comes at a time when the ability of the world's economic powers to control exchange rates is undergoing a severe test. 
There is great skittishness in the currency markets, and Mr. Brady will have to struggle -- in close concert with his counterparts in Europe, Japan and Canada -- to keep a handle on the dollar. 

   In addition, he will have to defend Mr. Bush's budget plans, which are sure to face tough scrutiny from those same foreign officials. 
At an expected January meeting of the so-called Group of Seven industrial powers, the Treasury secretary will feel intense pressure for significant deficit reductions. 
His new role in budget planning may help him assuage the foreign officials. 

   An indication of Mr. Brady's style is the report of the task force on the stock-market crash, which he headed last year. 
That report called for a sweeping restructuring of financial-market regulations. 
It also criticized U.S. budget and trade deficits, calling the budget gap "the unwanted and unpleasant stepchild of Reaganomics." 

   While winning praise from many, the report was criticized by free-marketeers in the Reagan administration for proposing an expansion of financial-market regulation. 
Some close Bush aides also worry that Mr. Brady will take too-activist an approach to government. 

   Scion of an Irish-American family whose wealth dates back a century, Mr. Brady is the former co-chairman of Dillon, Read &amp; Co., a Wall Street investment-banking firm. 
In 1982, he was appointed to serve the last seven months of the term of Democratic New Jersey Sen. Harrison Williams, who resigned amid the "Abscam" bribery scandal. 
Mr. Brady holds degrees from both Harvard and Yale.

<DATELINE> RAMALLAH, Israeli-Occupied West Bank  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the rooftop of her villa, 23-year-old Najwa can see a panorama of what the Palestine Liberation Organization now calls the independent state of Palestine. 

   She can see olive groves marching up terraced hillsides and the white stone of Arab houses gleaming against the blue sky. 

   She can also see more Israeli soldiers than at any other time during the 11-month uprising in these occupied lands. 
Army jeeps, radios crackling, rumble down the street every four or five minutes. 
From time to time, a sharp crack echos in the distance. 
Najwa isn't sure if the sound is gunfire or celebratory fireworks. 
Both have been in use since the early hours of yesterday when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat read his declaration of independence speech in Algiers. 

   Palestinians didn't get a chance to see that emotional moment: Israel's state-run television banned its broadcast, along with any statements welcoming his words from local Palestinians. 
On the streets of the occupied West Bank, the Israeli army was making sure Palestinians were left without any delusions about who controls the land. 
Refugee camps and villages were placed under curfew, with families confined to their homes. 

   About 800,000 Palestinians and 55,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. 
Army roadblocks prevented Palestinians from entering Israel and barred all journalists from traveling to the territories except with army escorts. 

   But on the many goat trails and donkey tracks that crisscross the West Bank's stony hillsides, a steady stream of illicit traffic made its way around the barriers. 

   On Najwa's rooftop, a group of students from the closed West Bank university, Bir Zeit, rehearsed each other in the lyrics and tune of the Palestinian "national anthem," titled "Biladi," or My Country. 

   "My country, I give you my love, my heart,
   "Palestine, the land of our grandparents,
   "To you I will surely return." 

   The students are waiting for 4 p.m., when leaflets issued by the clandestine "Unified National Leadership" of the uprising have called for street celebrations. 
As the hour approaches, they drift off in groups of two or three, making their way to a nearby refugee camp where a demonstration is supposed to take place. 
But every two or three blocks, they are stopped by soldiers, who tell them to observe the curfew and go to their homes. 

   They pretend to obey the troops' orders, but once out of sight, they scurry through back alleys and building sites, wending an indirect path towards the camp. 

   When they get there, they find that more than 20 soldiers have beaten them to it. 
There isn't any sign of a demonstration, nor any hope of one, with jeeps parked at every street corner and soldiers peering down from rooftops. 

   Elsewhere on the streets of Ramallah, the few Palestinians flouting the unevenly applied curfew clearly feel cheered by the independence declaration, even though they realize its effect is purely symbolic. 

   "I stayed up late last night to hear it on radio," says 19-year-old Essam Hassan. 
"After waiting all my life I felt I could wait up a few hours," he says. 
When the broadcast finally came, he says his family and their neighbors celebrated. 

   Sixty-seven-year-old Isa Kanolah didn't hear the news until he went out at 10 a.m. to buy bread. 
"Suddenly, all the churchbells were ringing, and I knew it must have happened," he says. 
To mark the occasion, he dressed up in his best three-piece suit and a checkered keffiyah headdress. (According to one witness, the bellringing pastors were later called in for a reprimand by the Israeli authorities.) 

   At sunset, Ramallah's streets exploded in a chorus of whistling, each shrill squeal echoed from building to building. 
Young boys gathered on street corners, setting alight makeshift fireworks that showered the streets with sparks. 
Within minutes, army jeeps raced to break up the gatherings, but from rooftops, calls of jaish (soldiers) gave the boys ample warning to disappear into the darkness. 

   "So, we'll wait, and celebrate properly in a few days," says 23-year-old Najwa. 
"They can't keep this level of troops stationed here indefinitely."

<HL> Trump Completes The Sale of Resorts To Merv Griffin </HL>

<TEXT>
   The sale of Resorts International Inc. by Donald Trump to entertainer Merv Griffin was finally completed, ending months of speculation that the deal might fall through. 

   Mr. Griffin's Griffin Co. said it paid about $96 million, or $135 a share, for Mr. Trump's controlling block of Resorts Class B stock. 
In addition, Mr. Griffin is paying $36 a share, or about $201 million, for the 5.7 million shares of Resort Class A stock outstanding. 

   Mr. Trump today is scheduled to buy back the Taj Mahal casino-hotel from Resorts for about $273 million. 
As part of the agreement, Resorts will pay Mr. Trump $63 million to terminate a service contract with Trump Hotel Organization. 

   Separately, Resorts reported a third-quarter loss of $339.8 million. 
Most of the loss was a result of a charge of $335.7 million to account for the estimated loss on the sale of the Taj Mahal and other assets to Mr. Trump and the termination of the service contract with Trump Hotel. 

   It took eight months for Messrs. 
Griffin and Trump to finalize the Resorts deal. 
Concern about the tax status of the Resorts acquisition and worry that the state of New Jersey wouldn't grant Mr. Griffin so-called interim casino authorization while proceedings continue for a full license threatened the transaction in the last few months. 
Both issues were resolved in Mr. Griffin's favor. 

   "It's been a tough pull. 
But now we're next door neighbors and we're friends," said Mr. Griffin, in reference to Mr. Trump's two casino operations in Atlantic City. 

   Although Resorts is a highly leveraged company, staring at a hefty interest bill of about $110 million to $114 million a year, Mr. Griffin said he doesn't believe the company will need to sell assets to meet operating expenses or service debt. 
"In our projections, we don't anticipate any sales until 1990, if at all." 

   However, he conceded that Resorts is sitting with a lot of assets and some should be sold. 
He noted Resorts owns about 150 acres of prime real estate in Atlantic City. 

   Mr. Trump said he expects full construction crews to resume work on the Taj Mahal tomorrow and that the hotel-casino should be completed in about 14 months. 

   Several industry analysts noted that growth in the Atlantic City casino industry seems to have slowed significantly in the last three months, a prospect that could make future operations for these two businessmen tougher in the future. 

   Resorts reported operating revenue of $123.9 million for the third quarter, compared with $118.1 million in the 1987 quarter, when it posted a $7 million loss. 

   For the nine months, Resorts had a loss of $357.4 million on revenue of $353.6 million, compared with earnings of $5.9 million on revenue of $348 million in 1987.

   Blue-chip stock prices ended higher as trading slowed to a snail's pace preceding today's trade deficit report. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar eased slightly. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost more than 62 points in the previous four sessions, rose 12.09 to close at 2077.17. 
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled only 115.2 million shares, making it one of the year's slowest days. 

   Broader stock market indicators also rose, but not as much. 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.62 point to 268.34, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.29 to 151.33. 

   Yesterday's stock market "was a little like watching grass grow," said Charles Eaton, a stock market strategist at Nikko Securities Co. in New York. 
Activity should perk up today, he said, after the government issues the merchandise trade report for September. 

   The average estimate of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report forecasts a narrowing of the trade deficit to about $10.5 billion in September from $12.2 billion in August. 

   The trade numbers are highly volatile but remain one of the most potent market-movers. 
Many analysts, including Mr. Eaton, expect stocks to rebound from their recent downturn if the trade figures are near those projections. 

   Still, some analysts seem convinced that even a spectacular trade report won't remove the bearish mood that's keeping many investors away from stocks. 
Yesterday, PaineWebber Inc. reduced the recommended stock exposure in its model portfolio to 19% from 22%. 

   Activity in other markets was also subdued. 

   In early trading, the dollar edged higher against most major currencies after the government released the October report on industrial production. 
The Federal Reserve Board said output at the nation's factories increased 0.4% in October. 
Later in the day, currency traders shrugged off the advance and the dollar headed lower. 

   Bond prices were mixed. 
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell early in the day after the Commerce Department's strong retail sales report raised fears of accelerating inflation. 
Retail sales jumped 0.9% in October, the biggest increase in seven months. 
Yields on the long bonds rose slightly. 

   Short-term interest rates shot up again, partly reflecting growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit. 

   In major market activity yesterday:
   Blue-chip stocks rose, but over-the-counter issues fell. 
Advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of losers, 715 to 709. 

   Treasury bond prices were down slightly. 
The government's benchmark 30-year bond fell about 1/8 of a point. 
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of prices, rose to 9.01% from 9%. 

   The dollar was slightly lower. 
In late New York trading, the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7428 marks and 123.23 yen, down from 1.7458 marks and 123.75 yen late Monday in New York.

   British Airways PLC said pretax profit was flat in its fiscal second quarter, as last year's acquisition of British Caledonian Airlines continued to depress profit. 

   The airline's pretax profit fell slightly to #141 million ($254.9 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from #142 million a year earlier. 
The results were in line with most analysts' forecasts; in trading on London's stock exchange, British Airways shares closed down one penny at 164 pence. 

   Net income fell 2.1% to #91 million from #93 million in the year-earlier quarter. 
Revenue rose 12% to #1.19 billion from #1.06 billion. 

   For the first half, pretax profit fell 4.3% to #222 million from #232 million, while revenue rose 12.8% to #2.21 billion from #1.96 billion pounds.

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>

   Researchers at the American Heart Association meeting yesterday endorsed a conservative, and less invasive, form of follow-up care for some heart-attack patients. 

   A federally funded study of 3,262 heart-attack patients suggests the use of clot-dissolving drugs needn't be followed automatically by mechanical intervention to clean out blocked coronary arteries, unless there is a demonstrated need. 
The study is expected to be published next month in the New England Journal of Medicine. 

   The study found that doctors who treated heart-attack patients with the clot-dissolving drug TPA achieved the same, high one-year survival rate of about 93% with a follow-up strategy of "watchful waiting" as did doctors who automatically rushed TPA patients into angioplasty or other surgery. 
In angioplasty, a tiny balloon is threaded into the artery on a catheter and then inflated to flatten out fatty plaque, which constricts blood flow and promotes deadly blood-clot formation. 

   The study could have important implications for the care of heart-attack patients, as well as its cost, and suggests a reversal of current practices favoring catheters and angioplasty. 
The news also could buoy Genentech Inc., the South San Francisco, Calif., biotechnology concern that makes TPA. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Genentech closed at $15.50, up 12.5 cents. 

   All patients in the study initially received TPA, plus the anticoagulants heparin and aspirin. 
Half the patients in the study then received an angiogram to disclose any arteries more than 60% blocked, triggering angioplasty within 48 hours, and, for some, bypass surgery. 
The remaining half of the patients, treated under the wait-and-see approach, weren't denied angioplasty. 
Rather, they waited until they experienced a recurrence of chest pain, signaling renewed blockage of blood flow to the heart. 

   Coronary re-occlusion, or the blockage that returns after treatment, is a recurrent problem affecting 20% to 25% of heart-attack patients receiving TPA. 
This is in part because TPA and similar drugs dissolve only the blood clot and not the underlying fatty plaque. 
Doctors have been trying to determine whether it is best to mount a preventive attack on such plaque or wait until it causes trouble. 

   In the study, "both strategies led to excellent results," says Eugene Braunwald, the Harvard University cardiologist who was chairman of the study. 
But because the more aggressive strategy leads to higher costs with no significant difference in survival rates, Dr. Braunwald adds, "The conservative strategy . . . has much to recommend it." 
He says most heart-attack patients "may be managed by TPA, plus aspirin and heparin, and followed by a conservative strategy of watchful waiting, with angioplasty used only if ischemia {blocked blood flow} occurs spontaneously or with exercise." 

   Cost savings of using the wait-and-see approach before resorting to angioplasty could amount to $2,347 a patient, Dr. Braunwald estimates. 
That would offset TPA's controversial $2,200-a-dose price tag -- a fact noted by Genentech officers yesterday. 
Sales of the company's drug have lagged behind expectations, partly because of its cost. 

   Dr. Braunwald emphasizes, however, that the patients in the study represented only 20% to 25% of heart-attack victims "in the center of the bull's-eye" -- namely, those who had moderately severe heart attacks. 
The study excluded the sickest patients and those over 75 years of age, as well as those who got to the hospital too late to qualify for TPA therapy. 
Clot dissolving drugs are best administered early and aren't usually given more than four to six hours after chest pain begins. 

   The study was sponsored by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health. 
A secondary finding of the study suggests patients can get some additional benefit if they receive immediate treatment with Metoprolol, a beta-blocker drug used to control high blood pressure. 

   At a time when cardiac catheter labs are increasingly the center of a mechanistic approach to heart-attack treatment, Dr. Braunwald says he hopes the findings will help create a new standard of practice. 
"You know," he says, "all the movement has been in the other direction."

<HL> Your Money Matters: Keeping Advisers' Hands Off Your Money </HL>

<TEXT>
   Seventy years old and confined to a wheelchair, Gus Hoehn should have been retired by now. 

   But the Pasadena, Calif., dermatologist has to keep working part-time because he didn't take the proper precautions when he put his trust in an investment adviser. 

   The adviser, Steven H. Henry, is currently serving a 10-year-sentence in state prison after pleading no contest to charges he stole $4.5 million from Dr. Hoehn and other clients between May 1982 and July 1986. 
Instead of investing the money for his clients, the Los Angeles district attorney says, Mr. Henry frittered it away on a "Rolls-Royce" life style that included four homes, a 33-foot yacht and shopping trips to Europe. 

   Says Dr. Hoehn: "He not only stole from me, he stole from my heirs." 

   Money-management scams are proliferating. 
"The financial marketplace has become so complicated that it's hard to make decisions, and people turn over {the responsibility} to someone else," says William McDonald, chief of enforcement for the California Department of Corporations. 
Too often, it's the wrong "someone else." 

   It doesn't have to be that way, however. 
Investors can minimize the danger of being ripped off by financial planners, investment advisers and money managers if they take the right steps. 

   The simplest advice, of course, is just to never give a financial adviser authority to invest money without your approval of each transaction. 
"Con men work very hard to get discretionary power over an investor's funds," says Barbara Roper, financial planning specialist at the Consumer Federation of America. 
"They usually draw up a plan with reasonable advice, and then suggest that the individual doesn't want the hassle of handling this himself." 

   That's how 50 Florida doctors allegedly lost $25 million to financial planner Henry Gherman. 
Mr. Gherman fled the country last summer, leaving each of the doctors with only a handwritten note: "Dear Client," it began. 
"By the time you have received this I will be gone. 
I have run away." 

   But while never allowing an adviser to buy and sell without specific permission can protect investors from con artists, it will also shut investors off from legitimate money managers. For those who do want to use a money manager, state securities regulators and attorneys who specialize in fraud cases make the following suggestions:
   ESTABLISH SEPARATE CUSTODY: Investors don't need to give money managers total control of their funds to allow them to make investment decisions. 
Instead, a bank can hold the investments in a custodial account in the client's name. 
That way, a money manager can buy and sell without having to seek specific approval of each transaction, but the manager can't appropriate the funds for his or her own use. 

   LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS: Several recent swindles could have been prevented if investors had only asked to see source documents for the investments their money managers claimed to be making -- things like certificates of deposit, stock and bond certificates and mutual-fund confirmation statements. 

   Dr. Hoehn, the Pasadena dermatologist, says jailed investment adviser Steven Henry claimed he was taking out a special high-interest $2 million CD, of which Dr. Hoehn would be part-owner. 
But Dr. Hoehn never saw the original CD -- only monthly letters from Mr. Henry purporting to show the CD number, the amount, the date due and Dr. Hoehn's share. 
In reality, there was no jumbo CD; and Dr. Hoehn says he had a loss of $500,000. 

   Mr. McDonald suggests that investors demand that their advisers send them original documents; at the least, there should be periodic meetings with the advisers at which they see the original documents. 
Investors should also spot-check banks and financial-services firms to see that money managers have actually bought the CDs, money-market funds and mutual funds they claim to have purchased and that they are in the investor's name. 

   SPREAD IT AROUND: The Miami victims of Mr. Gherman had their personal investments, corporate investments, life insurance, stock brokerage investments, pension investments and money market funds with him. 
As a result, many have been wiped out. 
If they had spread their investments around among several managers and advisers, they would have had something left. 

   WATCH FOR THE COMMERCIAL: Attend free seminars for education only, and be wary of free follow-up meetings with financial planners: They are often sales sessions for specific products. 

   Robert Kowtowsky, a retired Barrington, Ill., plant manager, rues the day that he and his wife attended free financial planning seminars held by Financial Concepts Inc. of Barrington. 
After meeting later with financial planners, the Kowtowskys bought $180,000 of real estate partnerships. 

   The partnerships have since gotten into trouble, Mr. Kowtowsky says, and he and his wife are faced with losses of as much as two-thirds of their money. 
"You don't get anything for free in the investment world," Mr. Kowtowksy says. 
Financial Concepts has been shut down by the state, says Richard Schultz, senior enforcement attorney for the Illinois Securities Department. 

   DO A BACKGROUND CHECK: If Mr. Kowtowsky had contacted the Illinois Securities Department, Mr. Schultz says he would have discovered that the founders of Financial Concepts didn't have licenses to sell securities in Illinois. 
He also would have found that the department had actions against them in 1982 and 1983 for violating state securities laws. 

   Similarly, Richard L. Allen, a Miami attorney representing victims of the Gherman swindle, says a phone call would have disclosed that Mr. Gherman wasn't registered with the Florida Department of Securities. 

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is another source of information. 
While there are 200,000 people in the U.S. who say they are financial planners, there are only 13,000 investment advisory firms registered with the SEC to sell securities. 

   Finally, checking an adviser's track record can do more than give you an idea whether the person is a good investment manager. 
"Most con artists move around a lot," says Ms. Roper of the Consumer Federation. 
"They have a limited amount of time to pull off their swindle. 
There's a point at which their scheme falls apart."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Orchid Oasis in the Bronx </HL>
<AUTHOR> Patti Hagan </AUTHOR>

<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's first Public Orchid Space opened this week in the Bronx -- the borough that nurtures, along with the Yankees and urban blight, this city's only tropical rain forest. 
With the Thekla E. Johnson Rotunda and Orchid Terrarium -- a million-dollar and 750-orchid gift from publisher Walter J. Johnson (and offspring) in memory of his wife -- in situ central at the New York Botanical Garden's Museum Building, the borough now has a secure, year-round orchid-viewing habitat. 

   Orchids are profoundly sexy, an observation that caused Charles Darwin to write a 366-page book, "On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and on the Good Effects of Intercrossing." 
Their often ostentatious, complex beauty is thoroughly, deceitfully utilitarian. 
In the course of co-evolution, orchids have contrived the floral likenesses of bees, spiders, wasps and flies among others, to the sexual cuckolding of those animals -- and the orchids' own pollination satisfaction. 

   Orchids also have seduced people, among them the late Thekla Johnson, a longtime member of the Working Gardeners of Bronxville (N.Y.). 
She was "an orchid fanatic" recalls Stefan Wilgermein, a retired senior gardener at NYBG, who worked 15 years with her orchids. 
"They were her babies. 
Once the cymbidiums got a virus and some had to be destroyed. 
I think she cried the whole night." 

   Mr. Wilgermein remembers that Thekla Johnson "paid special attention to the phalaenopsis," the demurely showy Southeast Asian moth orchids. 
Now she is one. 
"Phalaenopsis" Memoria Thekla E. Johnson, a white hybrid commissioned and named by the Greater New York Orchid Society, arrived here Friday from Hawaii. 

   It is impossible to get involved with just one orchid, as Mrs. Johnson learned, given an extended family that runs to upward of 25,000 species. 
Her namesake 176-cubic-foot orchid terrarium -- in the Victorian Temple of Love style -- can accommodate a mere scintilla, one-one-thousandth of the world's wild orchids, with again as many, maybe .00025 of the 100,000 already properly registered, named hybrids. 

   Not to worry. 
Keith Lloyd, the NYBG's curator of orchids, is in charge of orchid rotation into the Johnson terrarium, a vast bloom-dependent editing job, considering the 5,500 orchids in the garden's collection. 
Mr. Lloyd promises that the rotundal orchidarium will be "filled to aesthetic capacity, but not limited to the largest, the most colorful, or the prettiest. 
The unusual species will have equal place with the showy and large hybrids." 

   To this end the opening exhibition includes a number of wild minis that, due to the problem of orchid larceny, have not heretofore faced the public. (Orchids have long aroused the acquisitive urge. 
Back in the 19th century, as European imperialism expanded through Asia, Africa and the Americas, horticultural imperialism did too. 
Orchid hunters carried out the collective rape of wild orchids by the hundreds of thousands.) 
Bring your opera glasses and you can discern the intricate, quarter-inch orange blooms of a wild lepanthes, a minute epiphyte from the Dominican Republic making its New York debut. 

   "The garden's charter," says Mr. Lloyd, "states that the collections are for scientific research and the entertainment of the people. 
The species satisfy the scientific aspect, the large showy hybrids, the entertainment." 
And so you see the hybrid progression from the flamboyantly entertaining "Cattleyas" Lucie Hauserman and Tango through the souped-up extravagance of "Laeliocattleya" 'Pink Lady' to "Brassolaeliocattleya" Gold Country 'Fine Gold,' a Liberace of an orchid. (One fully expects a "Brassolaeliocattleya" 'Trump's Gold.') 

   From Thekla Johnson's collection comes the endangered Andean species "Odontoglossum warmingii." 
Mr. Wilgermein remembers that Mrs. Johnson was very fond of the odontoglossums, saying "they look like laughing faces." 
Also fond of them were the deadly competitive orchid hunters, who worked like strip miners, in the employ of Queen Victoria's own Royal Orchid Grower, Frederick Sander, and James Veitch's Royal Exotic Nursery. 
During the savage heyday of Victorian orchidomania, Albert Millican blithely recounted in "Travels and Adventures of an Orchid Hunter" (1891) how he armed 30 Colombian "natives" with axes and set them to "cutting down all trees containing valuable orchids {odontoglossums}. 
After about two months' work we had secured about 10,000 plants, cutting down to obtain these some 4,000 trees . . ." 

   Three Southeast Asian orchids from the Johnson collection, two "Paphiopedilum charlesworthii" and one "P. goultenianum," terrestrial slippers with waxy, embalmed-looking flowers, are out of preventive detention, too, thanks to the new terrarium. (Near relatives, the very tenuous and on paper protected "Paphs rothschildianum" and "sanderianum," from Borneo, are the object of continuing, devastating orchid cupidity. 
A couple of years ago one European orchid rustler helicoptered out hundreds of these rarities, smuggled them into Europe and sold them for $1,000 to $2,000 per plant.) 

   The point of the American Orchid Society's campaign "to remove the mystique . . . that the wild orchid is better or more perfect than the man-made one" is made by the wild fairy slipper "Paphiopedilum fairrieanum," potted next to its pixillated man-made progeny "Paphiopedilum" 'Elfin Charm.' 

   Also in the round are softly zaftig phalaenopsis dandling their "keikis," baby plants with roots and leaves, offset on flowering spikes. 
One can take in the "Phalaenopsis lueddemanniana var. 'hieroglyphica,'" with as yet undeciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics on every segment of every flower. 

   With the orchids in the terrarium, plus the thousands of backup plants benched to bloom in the garden's propagation range, there are now likely more orchids in 250 acres of the Bronx than in many once-orchidaceous areas of the same size whence the Bronxites' ancestors came. 
There -- in Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Madagascar, the Brazilian, Peruvian and Ecuadorian Amazon, Guatemala, Costa Rica -- the rain forests are being destroyed at a rate of 50 acres a minute.

<HL> Law: Hafts Sued by 4 Union Locals Over Bid For Stop &amp; Shop, Citing Fear About Jobs </HL>

<TEXT>
   Four United Food and Commercial Workers Union locals sued the Haft family in an attempt to hold investors responsible for jobs that allegedly may be lost as the result of the Hafts' unsuccessful bid to take over Stop &amp; Shop Cos. 

   In an unusual class action suit filed yesterday in state court in Camden, N.J., the union locals accused the Hafts of Washington, D.C., of forcing Stop &amp; Shop to accept a leveraged buy-out as a defensive maneuver. 
The borrowing required to finance the buy-out, in turn, prompted Stop &amp; Shop to sell part of its Bradlees discount department-store chain in a move the union contends threatens the jobs of at least 3,000 of its members. 

   Union suits against unsuccessful corporate acquirers "are a totally new development in which the workers are trying to get some protection against these takeovers," said Clyde W. Summers, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Summers, an authority on labor law, said he knows of only one other such action, a suit filed by workers in July against Wickes Cos. 

   That suit concerns the results of Wickes's abortive attempt to buy Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp. in 1986. 

   The central theory of the two suits is that would-be hostile acquirers who force companies to shed operations also harm workers who had a "reasonable expectation" of being able to keep their jobs. 
Mr. Summers said this argument "has a certain plausibility," but that its chances of immediate success in court are slim because of the lack of direct precedent. 

   Allan Kanner, a New Jersey lawyer representing workers in both suits, said that, in the case of the Hafts, the family has made a practice of launching takeover offers and selling their stake at a profit "without any intention" of acquiring the targets. 
The food and commercial workers are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from the Hafts. 

   In a prepared statement, Robert Haft, president of the family-controlled Dart Group Corp., called the suit "totally without merit." 
He said the family disagreed with the decision to sell the Bradlees stores but added:"We are not the owner of that company and obviously, we have nothing to do with their decision." 

   Stop &amp; Shop, of Braintree, Mass., has agreed to sell the leases for 47 Bradlees stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia to Hechinger Co., a Washington, D.C., operator of home-improvement centers. 
Hechinger has since said it plans to resell about half of the Bradlees leases. 
A Hechinger spokeswoman said that former Bradlees employees would be able to apply for jobs in the new Hechinger stores. 

   Stop &amp; Shop sold the stores, in part, to raise cash to pay off borrowings for a $1.23 billion buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and members of Stop &amp; Shop management. 
A Stop &amp; Shop spokeswoman declined to comment on the suit against the Hafts. 

   The $44-a-share Kohlberg-led buy-out topped a $37-a-share offer by the Hafts, who had made an earlier offer that first focused attention on Stop &amp; Shop as a takeover target.

      Landlords Crack Down
   On Breaking of Leases
   APARTMENT owners in the Southwest, where the economy is still struggling, increasingly are going after lost rent from tenants who break lease agreements. 

   In the past, the landlords generally allowed tenants to break leases without having to pay rent for the remaining months of the contract. 
The reason: Markets were healthy and renters plentiful, so vacant units filled quickly. 
But the lingering softness in many of the region's markets, largely caused by overbuilding, has made owners less forgiving. 

   In Tulsa, Okla., for instance, Crosshaven Properties Inc. recently started asking tenants who break rental agreements more than three months before the lease expires to pay two months rent. 
Folsom Investments in Dallas is making similar demands and reports tenants to credit agencies if they refuse to pay. 

   And in Colorado, "as we've gotten into tougher markets, we've seen more owners interested" in seeking payments from tenants who move out early, says Manny High, executive director of the 800-member Apartment Association of Metro Denver. 

   In these states, landlords generally have the right to charge the tenant for the duration of the lease. 
But landlords usually don't take tenants to court in such cases because it isn't worth the expense. 
Instead, they rely on collection agencies and settlements with tenants. 

   Some people are scoffing at the demands. 
After she got a new job in Cincinnati, Debra D. Dennis broke her lease on a $300-a-month apartment in Fort Worth, Texas, seven months into the one-year rental agreement. 
She gave the apartment owners 30 days notice, but they demanded more than $2,000 in rent for the balance of the lease. 
Even though a collection agency has contacted her, Ms. Dennis refuses to pay. 
"I'm not going to pay for something I'm not living in," she says. 

   Comparative Shopping
   Gets Easier for ARMs
   HOME BUYERS shopping around for the best adjustable-rate mortgage are getting some help from Uncle Sam. 
Lenders have started providing more details on ARMs, under a rule adopted last month by the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Reserve. 

   The new rule, which had been sought by Congress and consumer groups, requires lenders to disclose the index to which the ARM is tied, how often the loan is adjusted and the maximum amount that loan payments can increase. 

   A Bank Board spokesman says the rule makes it easier for borrowers to compare ARMs offered by mortgage bankers, thrifts and commercial banks. 
Previously, disclosure varied because the three agencies had different requirements. 

   Although ARMs are no longer as complex as they were when they first appeared in 1981, consumers have continued to complain about the confusing way these mortgages are calculated and the frequency of payment adjustments, among other things. 

   Real-Estate Studies
   Growing in Popularity
   DESPITE soft markets for commercial and residential real estate in many cities, several universities say enrollment in graduate-school real-estate studies is up sharply. 

   At the University of California at Berkeley, 113 students are pursuing an M.B.A. with a real-estate concentration, up from 50 at the start of last year's fall semester. 
Robert H. Edelstein, chairman of Berkeley's Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics, says student interest in the program "is higher than anyone expected." 
At Ohio State University's College of Business, 17 students are either majoring in or pursuing a concentration in real estate, up from three at the start of last year's fall term. 

   And at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, enrollment in the real-estate graduate program this fall climbed to 120 students from 80 students a year ago. 

   Even schools that began graduate real-estate programs this fall say demand has been greater than expected. 
At New York University in New York City, 144 students are enrolled this fall in the school's new master's program for real-estate development and investment -- almost triple the university's initial estimate. 

   Students are flocking to the programs because they think the industry's condition is cyclical and that it soon will be improving, says Mr. Edelstein. 
At Ohio State, administrators attribute the increase to students' interest in a more entrepreneurial career. 
Other administrators say some of the new recruits are students who changed their minds about careers on Wall Street after last year's stock-market crash. 

   The universities expect enrollments to continue growing. 
At NYU, administrators estimate next fall's enrollment in the program will swell to 250. 

   Odds and Ends
   BIGGER is better -- at least when it comes to the square footage of a new home, according to preliminary results of a consumer survey by the National Association of Home Builders. 
Also on home buyers' wish lists: more energy-efficient dwellings, more luxurious houses and larger lots. 
On average, today's new home fits the bill in every category except lot size, which has decreased because of high land costs. . . . 
Top executives at mortgage banking concerns, who receive much of their compensation from bonuses, have been taking home less money this year, reflecting a decline in loan volume, says Sibson &amp; Co., a Princeton, N.J., consulting firm. 
On average, chief executive officers have seen their total compensation fall 8% this year to an estimated $269,000 from $292,000.

<HL> International: Jamaica's Disastrous Hurricane Gilbert Has Political as Well as Physical Effects </HL>
<AUTHOR> Jose de Cordoba (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> LATAM </CO>
<DATELINE> KINGSTON, Jamaica  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The telephone caller's anger comes through loud and clear over the static of the radio talk show. 
He wants to know why, in the aftermath of Hurricane Gilbert, the government hasn't provided him with a blanket. 

   "The government doesn't have any blankets," answers Prime Minister Edward Seaga in the slightly testy tones of a schoolteacher addressing a thick student. 
But, says the island's conservative prime minister, the government will soon be providing relief stamps that can be exchanged for food and building materials. 
Griping and dissatisfaction over the pace of reconstruction efforts have dimmed the "Gilbert effect," which after the storm briefly pulled Mr. Seaga within two points of his opponent, Michael Manley, in the polls. 
Immediately after the storm, Jamaicans had judged that Mr. Seaga, with his close ties to the U.S., could get more reconstruction aid. 
But now, Mr. Seaga, who must call an election by April, has fallen behind Mr. Manley, his perennial socialist rival and former prime minister, by a 10 point margin. 
And Carl Stone, Jamaica's leading pollster, says Mr. Manley's People's National Party should increase its lead even further over Mr. Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party as Gilbert-inspired fears subside. 

   Nevertheless, Mr. Seaga insists that Jamaicans have gotten over their long-term love affair with the charismatic Mr. Manley, whose close friendship with Fidel Castro caused confrontation with Washington when Mr. Manley was in power in the 1970s. 
Mr. Seaga sees his chances improving. 
"When you have money, you can afford a lover. 
When you don't have money, you need a father," says Mr. Seaga. 

   Until Gilbert blew in nine weeks ago, Jamaica was enjoying a second year of strong economic recovery. 
But Mr. Seaga, a dour technocrat, hadn't transformed the bright economic picture into political capital. 
Jamaicans complained he had stripped social services and cut education. 

   In Gilbert's wake, Mr. Seaga has attracted an impressive amount of international relief -- as much as $612 million ($125 million from the U.S.), of which $381 million is new money. 
Insurance payments could bring in $800 million. 
Jamaica might even post a net foreign exchange gain on the storm, says Mr. Seaga. 

   The bulk of Mr. Seaga's relief-stamp programs is expected to come on stream this month. 
Most politically savvy Jamaicans feel that Mr. Seaga will call elections for early December, after a rush of rebuilding dollars has been released and before the natural process of dissatisfaction with any relief effort takes hold. 
An early December date would also skirt the winter tourist season, which brings Jamaica a third of its foreign-exchange earnings. 

   But human nature is fickle and the island's reconstruction is a sword that cuts two ways. 
Take Yallahs, a one-horse town banged up by Gilbert. 
It is the site of a pilot program through which the government grants Jamaicans whose houses were damaged up to $360 in stamps that can be exchanged for construction materials. 
One day last week, a crowd of shirtless, barefoot villagers had nothing good to say about the government's relief efforts -- although most had benefited from them. 

   Standing in front of a tent that has been her home since the storm, Jean McDonald is unhappy. 
"It's too small," she complains of the $360 in building stamps she got. 
"It can't make a good start." 

   At Yallahs' hardware store, Michelle Buchanan, the manager, shakes her head and says building stamps have given her "more headaches than men and broken hearts." 
People want cash, not stamps, says Ms. Buchanan. 

   Mr. Manley has been campaigning flat-out, conducting walking tours through poor neighborhoods where the faithful wear T-shirts bearing his photograph. 

   Off the hustings, Mr. Manley says time has made him a mellower and wiser man. 
Slinging a leg over an armchair in his comfortable Kingston house, Mr. Manley says that if he wins, he will again recognize Cuba. 
But this time around, he says, he won't let his friendship with Fidel Castro poison his relations with Washington or raise domestic hackles. 

   In the 1970s, Mr. Manley's socialist policies wrecked Jamaica's economy, but now he says his philosophy has changed. 
"We have largely abandoned the belief that the state has a significant role to play in production," says Mr. Manley. 

   Whether the middle class, overwhelmingly in Mr. Seaga's corner, will believe Mr. Manley, is another story. 
Mark Ricketts, publisher of Jamaica's only financial magazine, says many Jamaicans are parking capital abroad in case the new Manley turns out to be the old Manley. 

   The good news for Jamaicans is that Gilbert was less disastrous than thought. 
At first, Gilbert was portrayed as a mortal blow to the island's economy. 
Mr. Seaga likened the devastation in parts of the island to "Hiroshima." 
Initial reports put the cost of Gilbert's damage at $8 billion, a figure later reduced to $800 million. 

   Although many of the island's farms were flattened, Jamaica's key bauxite and tourist industries escaped relatively unscathed, as did most of its manufacturing base. 
Electricity has been restored to about 85% of the island. 
Most factories are back in operation, says Anthony Barnes, president of the Jamaica Manufacturers Association. 
Carlton Davis, executive director of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute, estimates the country will lose only about $14 million in bauxite and alumina exports, which last year earned Jamaica about $200 million. 

   Tourism, the island's largest foreign exchange earner, could be a tougher sell. 
Most hotels are back in operation, having used the downtime to refurbish. 
But Gilbert caused many cancellations. 
Take the Wyndham Rose Hall Hotel in Montego Bay. 
During the storm, a ham radio operator said it had split open like a banana. 
In fact, the hotel didn't suffer serious damage. 
But the publicity helped slash occupancy 50%, says manager Andrew Helal. 

   Government officials, who before the hurricane were expecting about 1.1 million tourists to spend about $595 million, now estimate 965,000 tourists will come and spending will slip to about $500 million. 

   Jamaica is aggressively wooing travel agents with everything from free trips to $25-per-head discounts for every three-night tourist booking before Jan. 31. 
A $15 million advertising campaign has as its theme: "Gilbert huffed and he puffed, but he couldn't blow us down."

<HL> International: Privatization on Track With British Steel --- Success Expected Despite Industry's Uncertainties </HL>

<TEXT>
   A year after its British Petroleum Co. share-sale fiasco, the government is trying to put the privatization locomotive back on the rails. 

   The vehicle: British Steel Corp., once the epitome of Britain's industrial decline. 
This time, the government seems set for success, despite long-term questions hanging over the global steel industry. 

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government needs a successful privatization to erase the painful memory of the #7.24 billion ($12.98 billion) British Petroleum stock offer, which flopped after the October 1987 stock-market crash. 
Last week, the privatization program suffered another minor setback when the government postponed plans to sell off Girobank, the post office's banking subsidiary, because the government hadn't found a suitable buyer. 

   The British Steel sale, expected to raise about #2.5 billion ($4.48 billion) would be the United Kingdom's largest-ever flotation of an industrial manufacturer. 
The sale also would rejuvenate the government's privatization program ahead of the huge sale of Britain's water industry, expected late next year. 

   For British Steel, privatization would cap the company's turnaround over the past decade. 
Once a byword for Britain's industrial decline, the company now ranks as the developed world's lowest-cost steel producer. 

   But despite this success, British Steel could find life in the private sector distinctly harrowing. 
The company, part of an industry highly vulnerable to recession, also faces long-term threats from lower-cost producers in developing countries. 

   The precise scale of the British Steel privatization won't be known until Nov. 23, when the government announces the launch price. 
Analysts forecast a per-share price of between 125 pence and 140 pence ($2.24 and $2.51). 
But the sale already seems likely to succeed; some 1.4 million British investors have requested applications for the two billion shares being offered. 
About one-third of the issue will be sold overseas. 

   As with most previous privatizations, investors should reap a quick profit, with the share price likely to rise above the offer level once trading begins Dec. 5. 
The company promises an attractive dividend to investors who hold on until August. 

   But in the longer term, the British Steel sale falls short of the virtual no-lose bet of some previous privatizations. 
The company is part of a notoriously cyclical industry that would suffer badly in a recession. 
And British Steel, like other Western and Japanese steel makers, increasingly "will be seeing more threats from low-cost, Third World steel companies," says Christopher Plummer, a steel analyst at consultants and forecasters WEFA Group in Philadelphia. 

   For many Britons, British Steel symbolizes the searing restructuring that manufacturers have undergone in the Thatcher era and the political seesaw they have ridden since World War II. 
The Labor Party nationalized Britain's steel industry in 1949; subsequent Conservative governments largely privatized it. 
In 1967, a Labor government renationalized the industry, forming British Steel from 14 companies. 

   Hammered by Britain's industrial crisis in the 1970s and early 1980s, British Steel racked up losses of more than #6 billion between 1976 and 1985. 
As mills closed, steel production slumped 32% to 11.7 million tons between 1976 and 1983. 
Employment plummeted 61% to 81,100 from 210,000. 

   A leaner British Steel emerged in the mid-1980s as a profitable maker of specialty products. 
Steel production has climbed back to 14.7 million tons, while employment has fallen again, to 53,000. 

   Analysts now call British Steel the developed world's lowest-cost steel producer. 
PaineWebber Inc.'s World Steel Dynamics unit estimates that British Steel currently spends about $435, before taxes, per ton of steel shipped. 
That compares with an industry average of $445 in France, $467 in West Germany, $475 in the U.S. and $535 in Japan. 
British Steel "is at one of the best positions they can be, at this point," says Mr. Plummer of WEFA. 

   Productivity soared as employment fell and manufacturing methods improved. 
The company needs just five man-hours to produce a ton of steel, compared with 14.5 man-hours in 1980. 
After returning to profitability in fiscal 1986, British Steel now forecasts that pretax profit for the year ended next April 1 will climb 31% to #550 million ($986.2 million) from a year earlier. 
The company's sales rose 19% to #4.12 billion in the fiscal year ended April 2. 

   British Steel says its success "demonstrates both its efficiency and its ability to react to varying market conditions," according to a preliminary prospectus for the share sale released last month. 

   "Obviously, the turnaround has been massive," says Ewan Fraser, an analyst at London stockbrokers James Capel &amp; Co. British Steel, he adds, "has been more successful than any other integrated producer" at restructuring. 
"It's a remarkably efficient company with an attractive product range." 
But the steel industry overall continues to suffer from overcapacity, an estimated 30 million tons in Europe alone. 
And analysts expect steel demand in Europe to fall about 1.5% next year as national economies slow. 

   Those conditions don't pose an immediate threat to British Steel. 
Steel supplies are tighter in some of its specialty niches, and the company's low costs would help it maintain market share in a mild slump. 

   But in a sharp recession, demand might fall far enough to spark a painful price war. 
"There's always a downturn coming up. 
In the world steel industry those downturns have come quite suddenly, and usually they're fairly steep," says Don Barnett, president of consultants Economic Associates Inc. in McLean, Va. 
"In the trough of a recession, you could have 250 million tons extra capacity" world-wide. 

   Even without a recession, steel industry competition is likely to sharpen. 
Like other Western steel manufacturers, British Steel faces growing threats not only from low-cost producers in developing countries but also from alternative materials such as plastics and ceramics. 
Analysts also question if British Steel can continue to cut costs easily, after a decade of restructuring. 
John Tumazos, a metals analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York, notes that "the extraordinarily easy improvements have {already} been made."

<HL> Harris, Williams Cos. Unit Are First to Offer Super 'Poison Puts' </HL>

<TEXT>
   In what could be the first of a flurry of new bond issues with greater investor safeguards, two corporations have filed to sell bonds carrying a new super "poison put" aimed at curbing highly leveraged corporate deals. 

   The new poison puts would enable bondholders to get back their initial investment in the event of a takeover, merger or recapitalization of the company that issued the bonds. 
Harris Corp. and Williams Cos.'s Northwest Pipeline unit will offer a total of $250 million of bonds with the new protection as early as this week. 

   In the wake of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s announcement of a $17.7 billion buy-out last month, the corporate bond market has fallen in disarray. 
Prices of many industrial corporate bonds have plunged because investors fear that a huge boom in leveraged buy-outs will load up many companies with excessive debt. 

   RJR's single-A-rated bonds have been transformed into high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. 
Prices of some RJR long-term bonds plunged 20 points, or $200 per $1,000 face amount. 
Buyers of corporate bonds have been demanding new safeguards to protect against a debasement of their bonds by highly leveraged deals. 

   The new poison puts "offer the investor significantly more protection than any previously employed in the high grade market," said Steven R. Bragg, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., lead underwriter of Harris's $150 million issue of 30-year debentures. 

   Investment bankers at Salomon and First Boston Corp., which is managing a $100 million, 30-year debenture issue for Northwest Pipeline, said both companies will significantly reduce their borrowing costs as a result of the new investor safeguards. 
The offerings were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week. 

   The new covenants attached to the bonds protect investors from more than half a dozen situations of corporate restrucuturing typically resulting in credit downgradings. 
The downgradings cause prices of these securities to lose a substantial portion of their initial value. 
The two investment banks, working independently, devised similar investor safeguards for the two issues. 

   Older-style poison puts have been attached to many new bonds offerings since 1986, when the leveraged buy-out trend took off. 
But in virtually all cases, these covenants ultimately proved useless to investors. 
The reason is that they allowed bondholders to "put" their bonds back to the issuer at par value (the issue price) in the event of an unfriendly takeover. 
That made the put worthless, since almost all takeovers ultimately become agreedupon. 

   Existing poison puts also failed to protect bondholders from a company's voluntary recapitalization, in which a company loads up on debt to pay a big, one-time dividend to shareholders or buy back its stock. 
Such a move results in the downgrading of the company's bonds. 

   The Harris and Northwest Pipeline offerings differ markedly from previous such offerings because they guarantee investors won't suffer the consequences of any restrucuturing, regardless of whether it's friendly or not. 

   The poison put in the Harris and Northwest issues is only good for 10 years, or one-third of the bonds' maturity. 
"Obviously, not every loophole is closed," said Mr. Bragg of Salomon. 
"But this 10-year protection is significantly longer than anything we've had in the past." 

   According to the prospectuses filed with the SEC, the issues protect investors against the following "designated events" if combined with a credit-rating downgrade to below investment grade:
   --The bond issuer, in order to defend itself, merges into another company. 

   --An outsider purchases more than 20% or 30% of the common stock of the issuer or its parent. 

   --The issuer, its parent or any related entity buys more than 30% of their stock. 

   --The issuer issues a major dividend or makes a major stock purchase totaling more than 30% of another company. 

   For Northwest Pipeline holders, Northwest Pipeline must do one of two things in the event the bonds are trading below par after the designated event occurs: redeem the bonds at par or adjust the coupon upward so that the bonds would trade at par. 

   The Harris issue differs only in that the option rests with the investor. 
The investor has a right to put his bonds to Harris issue at par. 

   "It's too early to say whether stronger safeguards are here to stay," said Curt Welling, a managing director and co-head of capital markets at First Boston. 
"This is is a high-profile subject. 
I would expect many investment-grade issuers are having a conversation right now about what the savings might be to have tighter investor protection covenants in their bond offerings."

<HL> International: Siemens Posts Increase In Profit But Leaves Dividend Unchanged </HL>

<DATELINE> BONN  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Siemens AG, the West German electrical and electronics giant, reported a 9% profit increase for the year ended Sept. 30 but left its dividend unchanged. 

   The profit increase was in line with analysts' expectations and was considered a good performance for a company that has had its share of troubles in the past year. 
But the dividend announcement disappointed some investors, and Siemens's shares fell three marks in Frankfurt trading yesterday, to 470 marks ($269.34). 

   Siemens's net income rose to 1.4 billion marks ($802.3 million) from 1.28 billion marks the previous year, while sales rose 16%, to 59.4 billion marks ($34.04 billion) from 51.4 billion marks. 

   The earnings increase followed a 13% decline in the previous fiscal year that led Siemens to cut its dividend last November to 11 marks from 12 marks. 
Since then, senior management has begun a sweeping reorganization designed to break the company's lethargy and reposition Siemens in the global electronics market. 

   Separately, Nixdorf AG, West Germany's second-largest computer maker behind Siemens, said it is likely to cut its current dividend of 10 marks. 
Nixdorf's shares fell 15.50 marks, to 390.50 marks. 

   Chairman Klaus Luft had been quoted as saying after a presentation in Boston Monday that flat profit in 1988 would be sufficient to maintain Nixdorf's current dividend. 
In a release issued yesterday, Nixdorf said it couldn't comment on its expected 1988 results. 
However, it hinted that last year's profit of 264 million marks wouldn't be reached this year. 

   "The decline in prices and margins has intensified in recent months," Nixdorf said. 
It also said previous forecasts of an 11% sales gain in 1988 couldn't be "confirmed."

   A federal appeals court panel rejected a bid by attorneys for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and other defendants to disqualify Judge Milton Pollack from presiding over the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil securities fraud suit against them. 

   In a 2-to-1 decision, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said that "an objective observer knowing and understanding all the facts and circumstances could not reasonably question Judge Pollack's impartiality." 

   Lawyers for some of the defendants immediately said they would appeal the decision. 
"We expect to seek either reargument or rehearing by the entire Court of Appeals en banc," said Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney for Michael Milken, Drexel's junk bond chief. 
Such hearings, involving the full court, are rarely granted. 

   A Drexel spokesman said the firm was "disappointed" with the decision. 
"We have not yet had an opportunity to review it, and our attorneys will be doing so in the next few days," the spokesman said. 

   Attorneys for Drexel and four of its employees had asked the appeals court to issue a writ of mandamus. 
The issuance of such an extraordinary legal tool requires the attorneys to prove that a judge abused his discretion or would be unable to exercise "dispassionate" judgment. 

   The defense lawyers had urged the appeals court to force the judge to step aside because his wife, Moselle Pollack, stands to receive about $30 million from a leveraged buy-out that Drexel is helping to finance. 
The transaction, they argued, poses a conflict of interest for the judge. 

   Barry Goldsmith, an attorney for the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said the SEC is "very pleased with the decision" and is "anxious to get on with the case." 
The SEC in September filed a civil suit against Drexel, Mr. Milken, and others, alleging that they had violated U.S. securities laws in connection with 18 different transactions. 
At that time, the SEC asked that its case be joined with 13 other insider-trading related civil suits over which Judge Pollack is presiding. 

   Judge Pollack is regarded by many defense lawyers as being tough on defendants in securities cases. 
In opposing the motion to remove Judge Pollack, first made last month, lawyers for the SEC had argued that Drexel and the others were merely shopping for a more sympathetic judge. 

   Speaking on behalf of himself and Judge Lawrence W. Pierce, Judge Richard J. Cardamone wrote in a 23-page opinion that the defendants "are entitled to an unbiased judge; not to a judge of their choosing." 
Judge Cardamone said that Judge Pollack's connection to Drexel is "too remote to mandate recusal" because Bain Venture Capital, a unit of Bain &amp; Co. -- and not Drexel itself -- is paying Mrs. Pollack the money. 

   Moreover, they rejected the defense lawyers' claim that Judge Pollack's earlier criticism of them showed that the judge was biased and therefore should be removed. 
As previously reported, Judge Pollack questioned the integrity of four defense attorneys, and he referred Mr. Flumenbaum and Arthur Liman, another attorney for Mr. Milken, for possible disciplinary action. 

   The two appeals court judges called Judge Pollack's actions an "appropriate" response to the lawyers' conduct. 

   But Judge Edward J. Lumbard disagreed with the other judges on the panel. 
Events, he said, "have created a reasonable doubt of Judge Pollack's impartiality in supervising these cases." 
He added that "Judge Pollack's expressed resentment to the suggestion" that he be removed and "his castigation of Drexel and its counsel has confirmed" that "he cannot act impartially in these cases." 

   A Drexel spokesman said the firm was "disappointed" with the decision. 
"We have not yet had an opportunity to review it, and our attorneys will be doing so in the next few days," the spokesman said. 

   Judge Lumbard disagreed with his colleagues on Drexel's connection to Mrs. Pollack and the judge, saying it was "hardly so speculative or remote." 

   Since the appeals court panel heard arguments by attorneys for Drexel and the SEC last month, certain facts have changed. 
Judge Cardamone, in his decision, said that Drexel had only a "potential commitment" to Bain because Drexel hadn't signed a firm commitment with Bain or Palais Royal Inc., the company that is owned by Mrs. Pollack's family. 

   On Friday, Drexel signed a commitment to finance Bain's purchase of Palais Royal. 
By late Monday, Palais Royal, too, signed an agreement to complete the transaction. 
That change is likely to be brought before the court in any petition to rehear the case. 

   When it agreed to consider Drexel's request to remove Judge Pollack last month, the appeals court temporarily barred all proceedings in the SEC case. 
That has meant that defense attorneys haven't been able to begin taking pretrial testimony from witnesses, as they had hoped. 

   It has also resulted in a refusal by the SEC to provide Drexel and others with many of the 1.2 million documents the SEC used to support its charges. 
The SEC had told defense attorneys that it could not give them documents while proceedings were stayed because to do so would be to engage in "unsupervised discovery." 

   Yesterday, some defense attorneys said they weren't concerned that a further appeal would create more delays in beginning the process of compelling pretrial testimony from witnesses. 
They said that because criminal charges are expected to be filed soon against Drexel and others, there would be few opportunities to examine witnesses against them anyway.

   A Mobil Corp. unit said it and a unit of Innopac Inc. of Canada are building the first plant in the U.S. to recycle polystyrene foam products used in food packaging, cups and other products. 

   The $2 million to $4 million plant will begin operating in January in Leominster, Mass., said Mobil Chemical Co., which is building the plant with the Genpak unit of Innopac, a packaging concern based in Willowdale, Ontario. 
The companies are negotiating details of a joint-venture agreement regarding ownership of the plant, said the unit of Mobil, an energy concern. 

   Growing public concern about plastic wastes has resulted in several measures in Massachusetts this year to foster more recycling, including a mandate by Gov. Michael Dukakis for state agencies to purchase recycled materials, a spokeswoman for the state Environmental Quality Engineering Department said. 
She said the state will be a major customer for the plant's products, which can be used for insulation and industrial packaging. 

   The plant, about 40 miles from Boston, initially will recycle foam products used in school lunchrooms and industrial and institutional cafeterias, Mobil Chemical said. 
Later, it will recycle products from fast-food vendors.

   "A lot of people don't understand inner peace," says Democratic congressman Tony Coelho. 
"You've got to have inner peace. 
You've got to feel good about yourself. 
And particularly if you're dealing with money." 

   As head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Coelho helped raise $86 million in 1986, much of it from political action committees. 
He stood amid a storm of legally sanctioned chicanery, and still kept his inner peace. 
His sense of his own integrity was impregnable. 

   Tony Coelho is the major figure in "Honest Graft: Big Money and the American Political Process" (Knopf, 337 pages, $18.95), by Wall Street Journal reporter Brooks Jackson. 
Like so many other former divinity school students, Mr. Coelho approached politics as missionary work practiced in another arena. 
"Unless you believe that the Democratic Party can really help people change their lives and provide some hope, you don't understand what I'm doing. . . . 
You don't understand why money is important," he says. 
As Mr. Jackson notes, "He radiated a sense of innocence." 

   By his own account, Mr. Coelho tells donors, "I want you to help out the party and I want you to do something, but don't think you're buying anything. 
Don't think that you're making a deal with me." 

   He granted reporter Jackson extraordinary access to his internal memos, an inside look at his fund-raising machine. 
Mr. Coelho must have been absolutely confident that Mr. Jackson would conclude as he had concluded -- that PAC donations are acts of corporate altruism. 

   Mr. Jackson found otherwise. 
"America is becoming a special-interest nation where money is displacing votes," he writes. 
The problem is not simple vote-buying. 
Rather, it is "that perverse incentives twist the behavior of ordinary legislators." 

   The most serious twisting goes on in the minds and souls of our members of Congress. 
When Mr. Coelho started opposing campaign reform measures, he didn't consider that he had become part of the problem he originally set out to solve. 
When he announced that he would record names of those PACs that did not support candidates he deemed worthy, he did not pause to realize that he was actually running a protection racket. 
When he started covertly influencing government agencies, he didn't stop to reflect on his own behavior. 

   Mr. Coelho talks about the meetings he has with oil company executives (he gets $2,000 per) as if they were philosophical symposia: "I believe that it's good to be educated. 
I believe that if you're going to be in the United States Congress you might not agree with oil companies, but it's good for you to know about 'em . . . 
I'm like a sponge, I love it, I love to be exposed." 

   He has constructed a hair-splitting moral etiquette to persuade himself of his essential innocence. 
"I don't mind {donors} bringing up that they have a problem {with the government}. 
But don't ever say it -- if you say it, it's all over -- that your money has bought you something. 
It hasn't. 
There's a real delicate line there, and it's hard for people to understand how we do it." 

   Mr. Jackson's portrait of Mr. Coelho is sympathetic, and many will find the congressman more a victim of the PAC system than a villain. 

   He is all the more pitiable in contrast with another major figure in this book, George Washington Plunkitt. 
The phrase "honest graft," which Mr. Jackson takes as his title, was invented by Plunkitt, the Tammany Hall ward heeler who ruminated on political philosophy from the bootblack stand at the New York County Court House at the turn of the century. 
Plunkitt was a mischevious rogue, and had a devilish sense of humor, especially about himself. 
He had two boasts. 
The first was "I seen my opportunities and I took 'em." 
The second was that his success came from "studyin' human nature and actin' accordin'." 

   Mr. Jackson uses Plunkitt's remarks at the front of each chapter to clarify the truths Mr. Coelho refuses to acknowledge. 
"You can't keep an organization together without patronage," runs the Plunkitt quotation in Chapter 1. 
"Men ain't in politics for nothin'. 
They want to get something out of it." 

   Plunkitt lined his own pockets while in politics, but he was honest with himself and candid with others. 
Mr. Coelho does nothing illegal, but he is self-deceptive. 
Plunkitt acknowledged that self-interest is the reason for most political involvement; Mr. Coelho denies it against all evidence. 
Plunkitt controlled his environment; Mr. Coelho thinks he is relying on the kindness of strangers. 
Plunkitt regulated corruption; Mr. Coelho pretends it isn't there. 

   "Honest Graft" is attracting a great deal of attention in Washington because it shows how bad things really are. 
Mr. Jackson does not write like a social scientist, but more like a biographer, tracing the peregrinations not only of Tony Coelho, but of characters who are more virtuous, and some who are more venal. 
He even concludes with a proposal to make political fund-raising less morally corrosive. 
The first step, perhaps, is to bring back strong party machinery, and trade in saints like Tony Coelho for sinners like George Washington Plunkitt.

   Dow Chemical Co., expecting to approximately double its profit this year, agrees with analysts' forecasts that net income will total between $12.50 a share and $13 a share and is boosting its plans for 1989 capital outlays, said Frank Popoff, chairman. 

   Mr. Popoff said in an interview prior to an analysts' meeting here yesterday that "we're going to crowd $13 {a share} but not exceed it." 

   Mr. Popoff also said that the Midland, Mich., chemical concern "has confidence in" a forecast that it may earn "in the mid $13s" next year. 

   Dow Chemical's stock rose 50 cents to close at $84.50 a share yesterday in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. 

   Dow, reacting to the boom in the chemical business, has accelerated various projects and now expects to spend $1.7 billion on capital projects next year -- a $200 million jump from the $1.5 billion previously anticipated, Mr. Popoff told the analysts. 
Dow will spend about $1.25 billion this year. 
Capital outlays last year totaled $995 million. 

   Research and development next year will "approach $900 million," Mr. Popoff said, up from the $750 million to $780 million the company expects to spend this year and the $670 million spent last year. 

   Mr. Popoff's remarks on profits indicate that Dow Chemical will report fourth-quarter net income between $3.18 a share and $3.68 a share. 
In the latest nine months, the company earned $1.76 billion, or $9.32 a share, on sales of $12.38 billion. 

   In 1987, Dow earned $1.24 billion, or $6.47 a share, on sales of $13.38 billion.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic religious order won a $3.9 million verdict against Touche Ross &amp; Co. for the accounting firm's failure to flag mounting losses in the order's investment portfolio. 

   Touche Ross's general counsel, Leon Gold, said the firm will appeal the verdict, which was handed down Monday by a jury in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. 
The trial lasted four weeks. 

   The Congregation of the Passion Holy Cross Province, a religious order with about 200 members in the western U.S., employed Touche Ross in the mid-1970s to review its annual financial statements, according to the congregation's lawyers, Thomas Ward and David Gustman. 

   The congregation, relying on an outside adviser, had placed its retirement fund in securities through arbitrage trading, Mr. Ward said. 
The congregation charged, and jurors agreed, that Touche Ross committed professional malpractice by allowing the congregation's financial statements to reflect the securities at an artificially high value and did not take into account the swings in arbitrage trading. 

   Touche Ross, which was not retained to audit the congregation's books, began restating prior years' results in 1980 to reflect the losses. 

   Mr. Gustman, who described the congregation's members as "wholly unsophisticated in financing and accounting," said the investment adviser was not included as a defendant, having declared bankruptcy in 1981.

   In the new position, Mr. Stevens, who is 41 years old, succeeds Larry Smith, 53, who resigned to pursue other interests. 

   Mr. Smith has been one of Enterprises' three top operating executives since the company was formed two years ago. 
He moved aggressively to consolidate its disparate, but critical West Coast operations. 
He has also been one of the company's strongest performers, posting some of its biggest volume gains, despite heavy price-slashing and fierce competition from archrival PepsiCo Inc. in the West Coast markets. 
Mr. Smith couldn't be reached. 

   Mr. Stevens is also one of Enterprises' top operating executives. 
He too joined the bottler two years ago, after spending part of his career at Pepsi and then participating in the U.S. marketing launch of Perrier. 
As president of the bottler's North Group, Mr. Stevens will be succeeded by P. Michael Taschler, president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Mid-America, an Enterprises' bottler that is being sold.

   The Reagan administration called the Palestine National Council's announcement that it has accepted United Nations resolutions on Mideast peace a "positive step," but gave little indication that it will produce a diplomatic breakthrough. 

   American officials said the Council's announcement that it has accepted U.N. Resolution 242, which implicitly accepts Israel's right to exist, appears to be a step toward moderation. 
But the U.S. immediately rejected the concurrent declaration of an independent Palestinian state that apparently would include the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem as its capital. 
The U.S. said changes in the status of territory must be negotiated, not decided unilaterally. 

   U.S. officials also warned that the Palestine Liberation Organization's continuing support of clandestine terrorist groups remains a serious obstacle to any contact between the U.S. and the group. 

   Nevertheless, the actions in Algiers could produce mounting pressure on the Bush administration, which takes office in January, to take at least a half-step toward the PLO. 
"The ball is now in the American court," said Yasser Arafat, PLO chairman. 

   Indeed, one State Department official said that, compared with five years ago, "the feeling is there is some movement toward moderation" by the PLO. 

   For more than a decade, American administrations have maintained that they won't negotiate with the PLO unless the group meets three tests: acceptance of 242 and a similar U.N. resolution, the explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist and the renunciation of terrorism. 

   Analysts believe the actions in Algiers were aimed largely at Washington, and it is likely that moderate Arab states and some Europeans now will argue that these steps should be rewarded by the U.S. to encourage the PLO to pursue peace with Israel. 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is trying to form a new government in Israel, rejected the Algiers declarations as nothing more than new tactical steps in the war against Israel. 

   U.S. officials, who haven't seen the full text of the documents produced at the Algiers meeting, warned that it wasn't clear whether acceptance of resolution 242, which the U.S. has sought, was coupled with other conditions that the administration would find objectionable. 
"There may be conflicting resolutions, or resolutions that tend to dilute each other," said Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman. 

   One test of whether the U.S. wants to make a gesture to encourage the PLO could come soon. 
Mr. Arafat is expected to file an application for a visa to come to New York to address the U.N. 
The State Department has said it will study the application with "severe scrutiny" when it is received. 

   It still isn't certain that Mr. Arafat will continue moving toward moderation. 
Despite his efforts to unify the Palestinians, several Arab extremist groups oppose any accommodation with Israel and are likely to retaliate for the actions of the Council, which acts as the PLO's parliament in exile. 

   At least two such groups, the Abu Nidal Organization and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, both backed by Syria and Libya, have assassinated moderate Arab leaders in the past and remain active today. 
Either group could try to derail any progress toward a settlement with Israel by launching new terrorist attacks in Israel and the occupied territories, or by reviving their past efforts to assassinate moderate PLO and other Arab leaders. 

   In addition, U.S. and European intelligence officials say Mr. Arafat has terrorist organizations of his own that still pose a serious obstacle to any official contacts between the U.S. and the PLO. 

   Mr. Arafat has tried to insulate himself from such groups. 
But intelligence officials believe the PLO leader, whom some U.S. officials have dubbed "the Teflon terrorist," has exercised substantial control over at least five terrorist groups in recent years.

<HL> Economy: Industrial Output and Retail Sales Posted Strong Gains for October --- Data Provide New Evidence That Economy Is Still Showing Steady Growth </HL>

   Industrial production and retail sales posted solid gains in October, offering further evidence that the economy continues on a steady path of expansion. 

   Output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.4% last month, the Federal Reserve Board reported. 
At the same time, retail sales jumped 0.9%, the largest monthly increase since March, the Commerce Department said. 

   Both reports showed widespread increases, with particular strength in the auto industry. 
Moreover, they follow a Labor Department report that showed surprisingly strong job growth in October. 

   "This suggests that the expansion is still well in place and that early concerns about it running out of steam appear to have been premature," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 

   In fact, the strong growth may add to fears that the Federal Reserve will push up interest rates to prevent an acceleration of inflation. 
"If you put the retail sales figures together with employment and the fact that the dollar has been plummeting then the Fed may feel it must drive rates up a bit," said Sandra Shaber, vice president of Futures Group Inc. 

   October's rise in industrial production, the eighth consecutive monthly increase, followed revised increases of 0.2% in September and 0.3% in August. 
The strongest gains came in auto assemblies and the production of business equipment and construction supplies, the Fed said. 
But it attributed much of the growth in the output of construction supplies to the settlement of strikes. 

   Production of home goods, such as appliances, rose sharply after dropping in September. 
But the Fed said output in this area has been sluggish on balance over the past year. 

   Mining was the only area of output that fell from September; it dropped 0.9%, the third consecutive month of decline. 

   Retail sales, ranging from purchases of cars and furniture to clothes and food, totaled $135.62 billion in October, up from $134.38 billion in September and $126.97 billion a year earlier. 
The increase followed a revised decline of 0.3% in September, previously estimated at 0.4%. 
The last increase bigger than last month's was the 1.6% jump in March. 

   While car sales climbed 1.7%, the increase in retail sales excluding the automotive industry was also strong, at 0.7%. 

   Durable goods and nondurable goods posted identical increases of 0.9%. 
Durable goods are items expected to last at least three years. 
Apparel and accessory stores registered sales increases of 1.2% from September. 
"Retailers have had sluggish sales for some time now, particularly department stores and apparel stores, and this is some sign of a rebound," Ms. Shaber said. 

   Food stores showed a 1.1% gain in sales. 
Some economists suggested the rise in food and clothing sales reflected higher prices. 
The figures aren't adjusted for inflation, although they are adjusted for predictable seasonal variations. 
Sales of building materials were unchanged from September while furniture and equipment sales increased a moderate 0.2%. 

   The retail sales figures are based on a relatively small sample of businesses and are frequently revised as more data come in. 
They don't include spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer outlays. 

   Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in October. 
The figures are seasonally adjusted.

<CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO>

<TEXT>
   Tokyo share prices tacked a few points on to the morning session's strong gains during the afternoon to close at another record Tuesday. 
Stocks rose in London in a subdued session and finished mixed in Frankfurt. 

   Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 308.51 points to close at 28829.41. 
Of that gain, 262.15 points came during the morning session. 
The Nikkei surpassed its previous record close last Friday and added 31.33 points Monday. 

   The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section gained 14.46 to 2234.15. 
First section volume was estimated at 1.1 billion shares, up from 582.4 million shares Monday. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index added 152.84 points to 28982.25. 

   Tuesday, the concentration in the 10 most actively traded shares, an indicator closely watched in Tokyo for what it tells about the breadth of investor interest, rose to 42.2% of total first section trade, compared with about 26% Monday. 
All but three of the 10 issues on the most active list were steels or heavy industrial stocks. 

   Nippon Steel, the most active issue on the Tokyo exchange, gained 41 yen to 909 yen ($7.35) on volume of 151.9 million shares. 
Kawasaki Steel rose 70 to 1,120, and NKK was up 28 to 910. 

   Financials took a breather after the preceding four days of steady gains. 
Among brokers, Nikko Securities fell 40 to 1,750, while Daiwa Securities was off 20 at 2,410. 

   Among banks, Fuji Bank was off 50 at 3,280, while Sanwa Bank fell 40 to 2,820, and Mitsubishi Trust shed 60 to close at 3,200. 

   London shares drifted for most of the session to settle firmer in uninspired dealings as the market found little stimulus on which to trade and chose instead to await Wednesday's news of U.S. trade figures for September. 

   A few select shares were energized by takeover talk, dealers said, but they added that they saw few substantive moves in share prices. 
"Institutions are still out of the game and without them, we can't expect to cover much territory," one trader said. 

   The Financial Times 100-share index closed 8.0 points higher at 1802.3. 
Dealers said they were encouraged by the fact that the index managed to close above the 1800 level. 

   The 30-share index was up 8.4 points at 1460.9. 
Volume was a sparse 341.8 million shares, compared with 479.9 million Monday. 

   Traders said the market was "quietly firm" after several sessions of steep declines brought on by nervousness over the sinking dollar. 
The U.S. unit traded on a steady course Tuesday, as market watchers contended that players are getting used to the idea that the new administration in Washington wouldn't significantly change course on its policy toward the dollar. 

   There is a wide range of expectations for the September trade data, with most forecasts calling for a narrowing of the deficit to between $10 billion and $11 billion from $12.18 billion in August. 

   In major corporate news, British Airways said its pretax profit was virtually unchanged in its fiscal second quarter as last year's acquisition of British Caledonian airlines continued to depress profit. 
The latest period's result was in line with most analysts' forecasts, and British Airways slipped a penny to 164 pence ($2.95). 

   Elsewhere, Plessey closed 8.5 higher at 175.5 in heavy turnover of 15 million shares, with large options activity. 
Dealers said the shares were boosted by rumors of a possible bid for Plessey. 

   Frankfurt prices closed mixed in moderately active trading after most of the market's early gains fizzled in a late selloff. 
The DAX index inched up 0.70 point to close 1262.54 after peaking at 1267.25 earlier in the day. 

   Equities opened mostly higher as several positive earnings reports offset continued worries about the dollar's trend, brokers said. 
Chemical concern Hoechst reported a 40% jump in third-quarter pretax profit, auto maker Volkswagen announced 22.5% higher third-quarter net income, and tire maker Continental AG predicted considerably higher earnings for the year. 

   But the positive impact of these reports was quickly lost when computer maker Nixdorf said it is likely to cut its 1988 dividend because of weaker profits. 
Following the Nixdorf report, traders began dumping most blue-chip stocks and pushed the market back to its opening levels, brokers said. 

   News that Siemens, West Germany's largest electronics group, decided to keep its dividend for the year ended Sept. 30 steady despite a 9% rise in net income came too late to affect the official session. 
But traders said that worries about the Siemens results had kept the market on edge all day and contributed to the sluggish trend. 
In anticipation of the announcement, Siemens slid 3 marks to close at 470 ($269). 

   Only Continental benefited from its report, jumping 5.7 to 264.5. 
In its previous forecasts, the company had been less optimistic, traders said. 

   Hoechst gained a meager 1.6 to 292.9, and Volkswagen was unchanged at 308.5. 
Nixdorf, which has had heavy losses in recent months as the company's earnings statements turned increasingly somber, tumbled 15.5 to 390.5. 

   Meanwhile, prices closed little changed in Paris, mixed in Zurich, Amsterdam and Stockholm and lower in Brussels and Milan. 
Investors in most markets sat out while awaiting the U.S. trade figures. 

   Among Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Seoul, Hong Kong and Taipei, mixed in Manila and Wellington and lower in Singapore and Sydney. 

   Taipei shares continued their strong performance as trading volume hit a record. 
The advance, which centered on electronics, steels and plastics, was the third consecutive market rise. 
The weighted index has risen 5.64% in that period. 
Volume Tuesday was 746 million shares.

<HL> Marketing and Media: Stakes Rising For Women's Magazine Field --- News Corp. Hires Mirabella For Fashion Publication As Conde Buys 'Woman' </HL>

   Two of the country's biggest publishers are taking off the gloves in the competition for the women's magazine market. 

   Yesterday, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it hired Grace Mirabella -- fired last June as editor of Vogue -- to launch an upscale fashion monthly titled Mirabella. 
The new magazine is expected to compete directly with Vogue, Conde Nast Publications Inc.'s flagship fashion publication; Hearst Corp.'s Harper's Bazaar; and Lear's, the new magazine for older women launched by Frances Lear earlier this year. 

   Conde Nast, meanwhile, is moving into News Corp.'s territory with an agreement, announced yesterday, to purchase Woman magazine from Harris Publications Inc. Terms weren't disclosed, but Conde Nast is believed to have paid about $10 million. 
Conde Nast also lured Pat Miller as Woman's new editor in chief. 
Ms. Miller has been editor and publisher of News Corp.'s New Woman, one of Woman's primary competitors, along with Hearst's Cosmopolitan. 

   Woman and Mirabella are at opposite ends of the highly fragmented women's magazine field. 
Woman's readers have a lower household income than readers of Vogue and the audience Mirabella will aim for. 
Woman's editorial emphasis is on advice about romance and careers; Vogue focuses on fashions and trends. 

   News Corp. made big inroads into Conde Nast's affluent audience with the launch in 1985 of a U.S. version of Elle magazine in a joint venture with French publisher Hachette S.A. Until recently, Hachette and News Corp. had also been discussing plans to launch a U.S. version of a French magazine called Femme aimed at an older and more affluent women. 

   But News Corp. sold its half interest in Elle to Hachette in September, and the two suspended talks regarding Femme, according to Murdoch Magazines President John Evans. 
Mr. Evans said News Corp. remained interested in launching a magazine like Femme, aimed at an audience of successful, fashionable women aged 30 to 45 "who know what they want and know how to get it." 

   According to Ms. Mirabella, editor of Vogue for 17 years, Mr. Murdoch was one of the first people who called her after she was fired abruptly by S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose Advance Publications Inc. owns Conde Nast. 
She said she had wide-ranging discussions with Mr. Murdoch and other News Corp. executives over the summer about their interest in starting a magazine. 

   Ms. Mirabella -- who said naming the magazine after her was Mr. Murdoch's idea -- said she has long wanted to do "a different kind of women's fashion magazine for a woman who knows who she is." 
She said the magazine will emphasize "style and quality of look as well as quality of thought." 

   Conde Nast's Mr. Newhouse apparently was more interested in spiffing up Vogue to appeal to younger and hipper readers; he replaced Ms. Mirabella, who joined Vogue in 1951, with 38-year-old Anna Wintour. 
Ms. Wintour has already started to change Vogue; the November issue dropped the traditional elegant cover for a wild-haired, blue-jeaned model wearing a jeweled T-shirt. 

   Mirabella, which will be launched next April, is expected to have initial circulation of 400,000 to 500,000, compared with 1.2 million for Vogue. 
Ms. Mirabella said yesterday she doesn't expect to compete directly with Vogue for readers, adding: "I'm not sure what Vogue is anymore." 
Ms. Wintour didn't return calls seeking comment. 

   Mr. Evans of Murdoch Magazines said his company believes there is a "gap" in the market for magazines aimed at affluent mature women that isn't met by such publications as Vogue or Lear's. 

   Myra Appleton, editor of Lear's, said, "It's just one more magazine," but added, "I wish her well. 
It will be interesting to see what she does."

   The series, begun last April, provided an arrangement in which brokers allocated a client's assets among the seven funds in the series. 

   A spokesman for the mutual fund organization said there were total assets of under $5 million for the series. 
Colonial Group has about $8 billion of assets under management. 
Nineteen jobs will be eliminated as a result of the termination of the series.

<HL> Economy: U.S. Car Sales Recover From Mild Slump In October, Meet Analysts' Expectations </HL>

   U.S. car sales in early November rebounded from a mild October slump and landed squarely in line with analysts' expectations. 

   The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for North American-made cars was 7.2 million, according to a U.S. Commerce Department formula. 
That was up from last month's 6.8 million pace and a sharp increase from the 5.9 million rate of a year ago, when sales were depressed because heavy incentives earlier in the year had pulled some customers into showrooms who might otherwise have delayed their purchases. 

   The 7.2-million rate of the latest period shows that domestic car sales are "pretty much on track," said Rex Franson, manager of sales reporting and analysis for Chrysler Corp. 
In all of 1988, the seven major U.S. auto makers are expected to sell about 7.4 million North American-made cars, compared with 7.1 million in 1987. 

   In early November, U.S. auto makers sold 186,521 domestic-made cars, up 18.8% from the 139,575 cars sold in the same period a year ago. 
Truck sales rose 8.7%, and total domestic vehicles rose 14.9%. 
There were nine selling days in the latest period compared with eight selling days a year ago. 
The percentage changes are based on the daily selling rate. 

   Of the Big Three U.S. auto makers, General Motors Corp. enjoyed the sharpest increase in overall vehicle sales with a 16.9% jump. 
Ford Motor Co. sales rose 13.3%. 
Its overall results were depressed by a slight drop in truck sales compared with a year ago when incentives boosted deliveries above normal levels. 

   Chrysler's total car and truck sales rose only 5%, hurt by sharp drops for its imported cars and trucks. 

   Of the foreign-based auto makers with U.S. plants, Nissan Motor Co. continued to suffer the most. 
Sales of cars and trucks made at its Smyrna, Tenn., plant dropped 7.8% from the year-ago period. 
Both Toyota Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. had sharp sales increases, mainly because of accelerating production at new plants. 

   Business in early November was helped by a broader range of incentives than those available last year. 
But some analysts expect even broader discounts as the quarter progresses. 
Industry inventory levels crept up during October to a 66-day supply from a 60-day supply according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry trade journal. 
That places inventories at the high end of what companies consider a comfortable level.

   "The accordion is the Zelig of musical instruments," says Guy Klucevsek. 
"When you play with strings, it sounds like a violin. 
When you play with reeds, it blends with the saxophones." 

   Mr. Klucevsek, who gets around his 4 1/2-octave "free bass" with the agility of a Horowitz, is one of today's leading accordion virtuosos. 
Of course, the very notion of an accordion virtuoso might seem odd. 
To some, the instrument is inextricably linked with the "Beer Barrel Polka" and "The Lawrence Welk Show"; to others, it evokes the comic antics of Weird Al Yankovic. 
And all of us have encountered the typical squeeze-boxer at weddings, who drowns out everyone else with loud wheezes. 

   But these days, the accordion's reputation is on the rise. 
One reason is the growing use of the instrument on albums by rock stars such as Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. 
Another is the burgeoning audience for various accordion-flavored ethnic musics: the spicy soundtrack for "The Big Easy" won new converts to Cajun and zydeco; Tex-Mex and Nuevo Tango have their own popular proponents. 
Finally, there are trailblazing virtuosos such as Mr. Klucevsek, who is expanding the instrument's parameters via his performances, commissions and compositions. 

   The 41-year-old musician has performed works by contemporary composers such as David Del Tredici, and by art rockers such as John Zorn. 
After avoiding the polka like the plague for more than a decade, he decided to take a fresh look at the genre. 
Tonight, tomorrow and Saturday, he'll play "Polka From the Fringe" with his band at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. 

   At his request, 30 "downtown" composers wrote short works using the traditional, two-step polka as a takeoff point. 
There's an atonal, Third Viennese School version by Rolf Groesbeck; rock-influenced hybrids such as Bobby Previte's "Nova Scotia Polka," with its ear-catching tempo changes; and parodies such as Christian Marclay's "Ping Pong Polka," a pastiche of dance cliches with an electronic overlay. 
"You could party to many of the works," says Mr. Klucevsek, "but there's some 3 against 2 that would throw your legs off." 

   The dark-haired musician grew up in a hotbed of Slovenian polka activity in western Pennsylvania. 
He began studying the accordion around the age of seven and formed his own band in high school. 
"We played Slovenian polkas and arrangements of 'Sixteen Candles,'" he says. 

   It wasn't until he began perusing music school catalogs that he realized his accordion ardor wasn't universal. 
"There was nothing under 'A' in their list of instruments," recalls Mr. Klucevsek, a stocky, bespectacled man who looks more like an accountant than a musician. 
"They all started with the bassoon." 
So he got his master's in composition, studying with electronic music pioneer Morton Subotnick at the University of Pittsburgh. 

   Alas, by the time Mr. Klucevsek started looking for bookings and commissions, the instrument's popularity was on the wane. 
During the mid-1960s, American teen-agers had transferred their attention to the electric guitar; in their minds, the accordion was inextricably linked with the hokiness of Welk's "champagne music." 
Sales plummeted in the little Italian town of Castelfidardo, long the accordion-making capital of the world. 
Competition from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and China added to the economic woes, and many Italian companies consolidated or went out of business. 

   Today, while U.S. imports remain paltry compared with the late 1950s, when some 300,000 units were brought in annually, the downtrend has been reversed. 
Castiglione Accordion &amp; Distributing Co. in Detroit, the largest U.S. importer/distributor, reports "a 40% increase in sales during the last year alone," according to its president, John Castiglione. 
Alex Carozza of Alex Musical Instruments Inc. in New York says accordions accounted for 35% of his business last year, up from 10% in 1980. 

   The main surge has occurred in accordions with Midi attachments -- a more expressive alternative that allows touch sensitivity as well as synthesized sounds -- and in concertinas or button accordions geared to the amateur that sell for $300 to $2,000. 
Top-notch instruments by leading manufacturers run between $5,000 to $12,000. (Mr. 
Klucevsek plays Giulietti or Titano piano accordions with the more flexible, more difficult free bass rather than the traditional Stradella bass with its preset chords designed mainly for accompaniment.) 

   The musician has had his own quiet growth as well. 
Three years ago, he had to supplement his musical earnings with office temp work as a word processor. 
Now he tours with Relache, the Philadelphia-based contemporary music ensemble, and last summer, he appeared at Lincoln Center's "Big Squeeze" Festival. 

   But solo opportunities remain limited because composers have not taken an ongoing interest in the instrument, which was developed during the 1820s. 
Although Tchaikovsky wrote an accordion part in his Suite No. 2 and American composers such as Virgil Thomson tackled the instrument during the 1950s, the classical repertoire remains pretty thin. 
Mr. Klucevsek, who lives on Staten Island with his wife and an extremely affectionate calico kitten, has added to it with his large-scale works for multiple accordions that create rippling walls of sound. 

   Still, a lot remains to be done. 
"We need more works by composers of stature," Mr. Klucevsek declares. 
"We need manufacturers who will quit worrying about whether their left-hand bass system is better than someone else's and standardize the instrument. 
We need more good teachers -- right now, there are only a half a dozen who can play the free bass with ease." 

   Over the years, however, he has learned to be patient. 
"The only reason I've accomplished anything is because I'm stubborn," he maintains. 
"I didn't keep at it out of any vision for the instrument, but to satisfy my own needs. 
So I just kept hanging out, doing my work, and fashions changed."

<TEXT>
   Great American Management &amp; Investment Inc.'s Great American Realty Inc. unit sought regulatory clearance to buy as much as a 15% stake in Formica Corp. 

   Great American of Chicago said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it holds about 1.1 million Formica common shares, or 9.95%, of the Wayne, N.J., maker of decorative laminates. 

   Formica, which declined to comment on Great American's move, closed yesterday at $14.75 a share, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   The bulk of Great American's holding comes from a group of Formica shareholders led by Malcolm I. Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y., businessman. 
Great American paid $13.1 million for an 815,000-share block and will pay about $4.5 million for a 283,200-share block it has yet to buy from the group. 
An additional 10,000 Formica shares were bought in the open market for $15.25 each, or $152,500. 

   Separately, Formica said it arranged a new $150 million line of revolving credit and a loan agreement replacing a similar $80 million pact. 
It said the credit will be used for acquisitions and working capital needs. 
It added that the new funds would be used to support its recent commercialpaper offering. 
The three-year credit accord allows the company "to pursue both the internal growth and external product expansion," it said.

   Japan's four largest securities firms said their pretax profits in the year ended Sept. 30 sagged under the weight of lower commission incomes and a slumping government bond market. 

   The firms -- Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. -- reported declines ranging from 18% to 38% in unconsolidated, or parent-company, pretax profits and 12% to 15% in revenues. 

   Commission incomes fell as the institutional investors that account for most of the big firms' business became relatively inactive in the wake of the October 1987 stock-market crash. 
Reductions in commission rates also lowered incomes. 
Meanwhile, higher interest rates weakened the Japanese government bond market, further reducing revenues. 

   Nomura Securities said pretax profit fell 18%, to 404.75 billion yen ($3.28 billion) from 493.58 billion yen a year earlier, while revenue dropped 12%, to 846.43 billion yen from 957.24 billion yen. 
Commission income fell 16% to 624.61 billion yen and the net gain on bond trades dropped 34%, to 36.7 billion yen. 

   On a positive note, Nomura's income from underwriting stocks and bonds rose 40%, to 86.55 billion yen, as stock underwriting more than doubled. 
Analysts noted that Nomura had the largest share of the second part of Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone's stock offering, as well as the biggest share of the offering by Japan Air Lines. 

   Daiwa's pretax profit fell 23%, to 224.69 billion yen from 291.29 billion yen, as revenue dropped 12%, to 526.78 billion yen from 601.74 billion yen. 
Commission income fell 15%, to 414.62 billion yen, while the net gain from bond trading dropped 57%, to 9.04 billion yen from 21.03 billion yen. 

   At Nikko, pretax profit fell 38%, to 148.68 billion yen from 239.68 billion yen, while revenue declined 16%, to 454.92 billion yen from 539.70 billion yen. 
Commission income fell 13%, to 399.75 billion yen, and bond trading netted a loss of 23.69 billion yen, compared with a year-earlier gain of 770 million yen. 

   Yamaichi's pretax profit fell 35%, to 143.24 billion yen from 220.92 billion yen, as revenue fell 15%, to 431.22 billion yen from 506.20 billion yen. 
Income from commissions fell 15%, to 376.79 billion yen. 
Bond trading resulted in a loss of 17.87 billion yen, compared with a year-earlier loss of 10.27 billion yen.

   "Master the possibilities," exhorted MasterCard International in a recent advertising campaign. 
But in running its own affairs, the second largest credit card company is trying to master some fundamental challenges. 

   After making strides to recover ground lost to arch-rival Visa International, MasterCard lately appears mired in a perpetual runner-up status. 
Last year, the not-for-profit organization controlled by about 150 big banks ran a $5.3 million deficit. 

   And merchants and processors are in near-revolt over a surprise increase in the fee that card-issuing banks charges merchants for each purchase made with a MasterCard. 

   MasterCard's directors, 26 executives from member banks world-wide, will meet tomorrow in Palm Springs, Calif., to consider steps to get MasterCard back on track. 

   In the most important of these decisions, the directors -- as early as tomorrow -- could name a successor to Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive officer for the past 8 1/2 years. 
Mr. Hogg announced his resignation July 14 in what industry executives say was a disagreement with the board over the heavy level of expenditures. 

   The board is also expected to trim its fee increase, set to take effect Jan. 1, to placate merchants and processors. 

   Board members declined to discuss the subject of Mr. Hogg's successor, but industry watchers say the heavy favorite is Alex W. "Pete" Hart, executive vice president for retail banking at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp. and a MasterCard board member. 
Mr. Hart didn't return several phone calls seeking comment. 

   It was Mr. Hogg who turned MasterCard into a spirited competitor. 
Until the late 1970s, MasterCard held an edge over Visa and American Express Co. in charge volume. 
But in 1979 MasterCard slipped behind Visa as competitors devised better advertising campaigns and pioneered new technology. 

   Under Mr. Hogg, who formerly worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and American Express, MasterCard in 1983 introduced the concept of the premium credit card. 
Today, the Gold MasterCard is the leading premium credit card. 

   (Charge cards, such as the American Express green card, require the holder to pay the balance monthly. 
Credit cards allow consumers to pay balances over an extended period at annual interest rates as high as 19.5%.) 

   For all its innovations, which have helped MasterCard more than triple its annual volume since 1981, regaining the industry's top spot remains elusive. 
Visa has matched that pace, thereby widening the volume gap between it and MasterCard. 

   And MasterCard has a new competitor nipping at its heels -- the Optima card, American Express's new entry. 
Not even two years old, Optima has already vaulted into the ranks of the top 10 bank cards. 

   Currently, Visa and MasterCard have the advantage of being accepted by more merchants and of costing merchants less than Optima. 
But American Express is aggressively expanding its merchant base and encouraging holders of its green, gold and platinum cards to take Optima. 

   Mr. Hogg's abrupt resignation caught the industry by surprise. 
Credit card industry experts attribute it to Chairman Arthur B. Ziegler's desire for a leaner, more efficient operation. 
Mr. Ziegler, also a sector executive of Marine Midland Banks Inc., the New York unit of Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp., declined to discuss the matter. 

   Mr. Hogg is known for his grandiose style. 
Fond of gold cufflinks and custom-tailored shirts, he usually stays in the presidential suite of the finest hotels when traveling, bankers say. 
At his suggestion, MasterCard leased a one-bedroom apartment in New York's posh Trump Tower to entertain members and clients. 

   Those tastes were also reflected in some of Mr. Hogg's strategic moves. 
He championed industry-wide adoption of the "smart card," which keeps an account's relevant data on a computer chip embedded in the card. 
But MasterCard's board -- and Visa's -- rejected the concept because of the costs involved. 
The move would have required a huge investment in new technology by processors and merchants. 

   In addition, MasterCard has drawn fire from some members for what they say are investments in technology that far exceed MasterCard's needs. 
The two most notable investments were last year's purchase of the Cirrus automated teller network for $34 million and an estimated $40 million spent since 1981 to develop the Banknet communications system. 

   Several MasterCard directors grew uneasy about such expenses, particularly when many of their own banks were cutting costs, bankers say. 
Credit cards remain banks' most profitable product, generating a 3% to 5% annual return at a time when banks are generally earning about 1% on assets. 
Consequently, the vitality of Visa and MasterCard is extremely important to banks. 

   "There was this sense that MasterCard was being run lavishly without controls," says John Love, publisher of Bank Card News, a trade publication. 

   But Mr. Hogg's defenders reject that suggestion. 
"If you're No. 2 and you want to be No. 1, do you spend like you're No. 2?" asks one who requested anonymity. 
"Russ was getting second-guessed by the board. 
The board was getting into a lot of day-to-day business." 
Mr. Hogg couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Even though the job is rumored to pay $500,000 a year, finding a successor hasn't been easy. 
Pressure is building to fill the spot quickly. 
"We need to fill that spot soon or else we'll lose momentum," says a MasterCard official. 

   To spare a new president a major embarrassment, MasterCard's board tomorrow is expected to scale back increases of as much as 29% in the fees that merchants and processors pay banks for purchases made with MasterCards. 

   The increase in the so-called interchange rate, announced in September, was widely criticized by merchants and processors, who argue that it is excessive. 
Retailers such as Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us have registered their displeasure about the rise, and Mr. Hogg hinted recently that MasterCard would trim its rate increase. 

   However, a retreat on the interchange fee could undercut MasterCard's efforts to overtake Visa. 
By raising the fee that bankers collect on purchases, MasterCard would provide card-issuing banks with a powerful incentive to put MasterCards rather than Visas in their customers' hands. 
If MasterCard's rate remains in line with Visa's, banks lose their incentive to prefer one card over the other. 

   An executive at one of the biggest card-issuing banks, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that view: "The interchange fee is very important to us. 
If MasterCard remained committed to the higher fee, we definitely would issue more MasterCards."

   Three former employees of Quasar Co. were awarded more than $1.9 million in lost wages by a federal court jury that found the three were victims of age discrimination. 

   The verdict, returned here Monday, also dismissed the age-discrimination claim of a fourth ex-employee. 
All four employees -- whose ages ranged from 53 to 60 -- were fired in 1986 from their jobs at Quasar's Franklin Park, Ill., facility. 

   U.S. District Judge James Alesia, who presided over the trial, is considering a second claim by the employees that they were also victims of discrimination against non-Japanese employees. 
Quasar, which makes electronics products, is a division of Matsushita Electric Corp. of America, based in Secacus, N.J. Matsushita Electric is a unit of Matsushita Industrial Ltd., Japan. 

   A Quasar spokesman said in a prepared statement that the "separation of the employees from Quasar was solely due to a reduction in work force necessitated by business reversals. 
It had nothing to do whatsoever with any discrimination on our part." 
Quasar intends to appeal, the spokesman said. 

   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that subsidiaries of foreign companies operating in the U.S. are subject to U.S. anti-discrimination laws.

This compound could provide an important backup to Chromakalim, particularly if eventual Chromakalim sales are depressed by the stigma of the suspension of testing, an analyst said. 

   The earlier suspension came after Beecham found negative side effects in monkeys involved in parallel toxicity trials. 
Beecham said it concluded from further study of these side effects that the tests should proceed, subject to regulatory approval. 

   The company emphasized that "there is no evidence of cardiac toxicity in patients taking part in clinical studies with Chromakalim." 
In the parallel testing, some of the monkeys, receiving 100 times the normal human dosage, developed inflammation of the heart muscles. 

   Arnab Banerji, a pharmaceutical analyst at Nomura Research Institute, said Beecham's plans to resume testing of Chromakalim removed many of the doubts overhanging the drug's prospects. 

   Despite plans to resume testing, Beecham expects the problems Chromakalim has encountered likely will delay the planned launch of the drug by about two years, according to a spokesman. 
The company now expects Chromakalim to reach the market by 1994 or 1995.

<HL> Politics &amp; Policy: Bush Is Expected To Pick Sununu As Chief of Staff </HL>

   President-elect George Bush is almost certain to name New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu his White House chief of staff, according to high-ranking sources on his transition team. 

   Mr. Bush promised to make his announcement "fairly soon." 
But some Bush aides cautioned the announcement might not come until next week, and some of the president-elect's advisers may still resist the choice of Gov. Sununu. 

   Mr. Sununu, a smart and assertive political operator, would be a particularly popular choice among conservatives, who have been lobbying for his selection. 
The three-term governor, 49 years old, had been pushed for the job by some Bush associates because they think he has the age and stature to act as a surrogate for the 64-year-old Mr. Bush. 

   The choice is particularly important because the chief of staff will have a large voice in picking other White House staffers, and because conservatives have identified the appointment as a top priority for the cause. 

   Mr. Bush himself, in a brief meeting with reporters yesterday, indicated that his new staff chief would play a central role in picking administration personnel. 
"I'd like to make that decision soon because I think then that person can start working toward staffing the White House," he said. 

   Gov. Sununu has been considered the leading candidate for the job in part because he held a private dinner with Mr. Bush Monday night in Florida before the vice president returned from vacation. 
He is the only political associate who visited Mr. Bush during his vacation. 

   The other leading contender for the chief of staff's job is Craig Fuller, the 37-year-old chief of Mr. Bush's vice presidential staff. 
Some Bush aides have argued that Mr. Fuller should get the job because of what they consider his superior experience in Washington. 
Mr. Fuller served as a senior White House aide for President Reagan before heading Mr. Bush's vice presidential staff. 

   Mr. Sununu is seen as more partisan than Mr. Fuller, which appeals to many Republicans. 

   But that also could alienate some Democrats, who consider Mr. Sununu a hardliner on many issues on which they are hoping to compromise with the new president, particularly taxes. 
Aides to House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) warn that the selection of Mr. Sununu would harm relations with the Democratic-controlled Congress. 

   Some Bush aides have speculated that the new president might try to avoid choosing among the contenders for the chief of staff's job by devising a White House power structure in which authority would be shared by Messrs. 
Sununu, Fuller and Robert Teeter, the vice president's longtime pollster and political adviser. 
But such a "troika" seems less likely to emerge than once thought, some Bush advisers said. 

   The selection of a White House chief of staff could clear the way for other top administration appointments before the Thanksgiving break. 
Other contenders for administration jobs generally appear to be moderates, although they might prove acceptable to conservatives. 

   Deborah Steelman, a former official at the Office of Management and Budget who was domestic issues adviser for the Bush presidential campaign, is considered a candidate to be secretary of housing and urban development. 
Another is William Hudnut, the mayor of Indianapolis. 

   Robert Mossbacher, a Houston businessman and longtime Bush friend, is considered a possible secretary of commerce. 
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.), also a longtime Bush friend, is mentioned by Bush aides as a possible special trade representative or secretary of Health and Human Services. 
Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio) also is a possible HHS secretary.

<TEXT>
   Westmoreland Coal Co. agreed to sell its Colorado Westmoreland Inc. subsidiary to a unit of Cyprus Minerals Co. for $7 million, plus future payments of up to $3 million based on coal shipments. 

   Westmoreland, based in Philadelphia, said it will recognize a gain of about $18 million on the sale of the unit, which operates the Orchard Valley Mine near Paonia, Colo. 
The company had written off the unit last December and set up reserves as if it had been closed over a three-year period. 

   Since the unit is being sold as an operating concern, Westmoreland will adjust its income statement to reflect the portion of reserves not utilized, as well as $4.7 million in operating earnings from the unit. 

   But Westmoreland said this gain might not be fully realized as profit in the fourth quarter, because it might be offset by continuing operations or by the sale or re-evaluation of other assets.

   Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc. said it dropped plans to seek federal approval of its drug Isoprinosine for certain pre-AIDS conditions following tests that showed the drug to be ineffective in treating those conditions. 

   The tests were conducted over a two-year period in the U.S. and the United Kingdom on 696 patients with AIDS-related complex, a precursor to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
They followed earlier, small-scale tests that indicated that the drug might be effective in encouraging production of so-called "T-helper" lymphocyte cells, which are depleted in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, also an AIDS precursor. 

   Newport Pharmaceuticals' announcement was made after the stock market closed. 
Yesterday, the company's stock fell 6.25 cents a share, closing at $5.8125 in national over-the-counter trading. 

   Newport Pharmaceuticals, based in Newport Beach, Calif., said it will continue two other large-scale tests of Isoprinosine on patients in Scandinavia and Australia whose illnesses haven't progressed as far as those of patients in the U.S. and United Kingdom study. 

   Depending on the results, the company said, it may seek Food and Drug Administration approval for the use of Isoprinosine by patients whose diseases are less advanced. 
Results of the first of those tests, the Scandinavian sample, are expected next year. 

   Isoprinosine is an immunomodulating drug currently used to treat various infections, including herpes simplex. 
Newport Pharmaceuticals said the drug will continue to be sold for those conditions. 

   A company official said Newport Pharmaceuticals has spent "tens of millions" of dollars on the AIDS-related clinical tests of Isoprinosine but declined to be more specific. 
He said the outlays were accounted for as they were incurred. 
Thus, future charges against earnings related to the tests apparently won't be needed.

<DATELINE> BARCELONA, Spain  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Spain, 1992 is triple witching year. 

   Barcelona will play host to the Olympics. 
Seville will hold a World's Fair marking the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. 
Spain will become a fully integrated member of what is to become a fully integrated Common Market. 

   The Olympics and the World's Fair will be important, Spaniards say. 
The full absorption of Spain into Europe will be fun. 

   More than any other people in the European Community, Spaniards are yearning for 1992. 
They say a united Europe is Spain's best guarantee that the breath of democracy the country has enjoyed since 1977 will become natural respiration, that the door to the world will stay open, that Spain each day will become a little more like West Germany and a little less like Mexico. 

   "Spain is truly a European country now," Jaime Martorell Suarez says proudly. 
"We've left the Third World far behind." 
Mr. Martorell, marketing manager for a U.S.-Spanish microchip joint venture, recalls the great fear Spain had of a flood of imports after it joined the Common Market two years ago and lowered its tariffs. 
"You don't hear that fear about 1992," he says. 
"All you hear is the sound of opportunity." 

   Determined to seize it, Spaniards are busily forming joint ventures that bring technology and jobs. 
They are turning family yarn firms that can't compete without tariffs into diversified textile companies that can. 
They are merging small Spanish banks and companies to form medium-sized European ones. 
They are seeking knowledge and profit from helping foreign multinationals invest here. 
They are becoming more entrepreneurial inside Spain, and poking their noses outside. 
They are trying to switch over from welcoming short-stay tourists to becoming Northern Europe's retirement home. 

   All this activity stems from an unswerving optimism about 1992 despite the crises facing once-protected Spanish industries like chemicals and textiles as tariff barriers fall. 
The optimism overcomes queasiness about the influx of foreign investors eager to conquer Europe by using Spanish labor that is up to 50% cheaper. 
It overcomes concerns, for instance, that Spain could become simply Europe's garage: Spain is the world's sixth-biggest car maker, but not one of the car plants here is Spanish-owned. 

   Jordi Alberich, secretary of a Barcelona business group, shrugs at such worries. 
"If the jobs are here, who cares who owns the plants?" he asks. 
"If we want to be a leading country, we've got to be open, to act like a leading country." 

   Spain is. 
With a suddenness that surprises even them, Spaniards who a decade ago seemed cut off from the world -- the legacy of 40 years of Francoism -- chat knowledgeably about the Dow Jones industrials, Eurobond interest-rate spreads and the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
They bustle along wide avenues in Barcelona and Madrid that house more foreign banks than Frankfurt. 
They borrow from Manufacturers Hanover, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. 
They buy, with the relish of the long-starved, Cote d'Or chocolates from Belgium, Electrolux refrigerators from Sweden, Buitoni pasta from Italy. 
They read the news in English, French, German, Italian. 

   What the Spanish don't do is worry about 1992 the way their neighbors do. 
The French worry about the removal of most European trade barriers in four years because their companies aren't as big as German companies. 
The Italians worry that their parliament doesn't work as well as Britain's does. 
The British worry about everything concerning 1992. 

   "We're not afraid of anybody," says a Barcelona businessman, Carlos Barnils Deulonder. 
"We're probably wrong, but we're not afraid of anybody." 

   They're too busy to be afraid. 
Mr. Barnils, for instance, has time only for a quick, though tall, gin and tonic in a crowded Barcelona bar after a day spent huddling with his West German supplier of refrigerators. 
He readily concedes that his refrigerator-components business grew comfortably behind 40% tariffs that kept all competition out. 
Under Spain's agreement to join the EC, those tariffs have come down to 7%, and they will vanish in 1992. 
To survive, he has joined the enemy in joint ventures, trading his knowledge of the Spanish market for products and know-how. 
In the middle of describing his venture with Westinghouse Electric of the U.S. and his talks with a Japanese company for a similar deal, Mr. Barnils has to leave for a 9 p.m. dinner with the Germans. 

   Andreu Soldevila gets to his Barcelona office at 9 the next morning to continue changing nearly everything about the family business he and his brother took over five years ago. 
He has a computer on one corner of his desk and a thick wad of printouts in the middle of it. 
His father and grandfather made cotton yarn in Barcelona and sold it mainly in Spain. 
The younger Soldevilas -- Andreu is 40 -- cut their work force to 1,200 from 1,500 and plan to get down to 800 by 1992, all the while introducing new machines to keep yarn output exactly the same. 

   Meanwhile, they have diversified into fancier, customized yarns -- "stuff the Third World producers can't make yet" -- as well as into real estate and hotels. 
As factory workers are laid off, multilingual salesmen are added. 
A subsidiary has been opened in Portugal, and offices in West Germany and Denmark are planned. 
The company now exports 15% of its output and hopes to double that by 1992. 
The business he will leave to the next generation won't look at all like the one he inherited, Mr. Soldevila says. 
"We're not worried about 1992," he says. 
"We're getting ready for it." 

   Also getting ready are many smallish Spanish companies and banks. 
In recent months, mergers have joined four of Spain's seven biggest banks. 
Combining, too, are two of Spain's oldest industrial rivals, Grupo Cros and Union Explosivos Rio Tinto S.A. (which is partly owned by the Kuwaitis), into Spain's biggest chemical company. 
The merger was forced when French and Italian producers amassed a stunning 30% of Spain's fertilizer market within a year of tariffs' coming down. 

   Josep Pique, a bright-eyed 33-year-old executive, runs an electroplating division of the merged businesses. 
Sitting in temporary quarters in an oak-paneled board room under the benevolent gaze of founder Mateo Cros, Mr. Pique chomps a big Havana cigar and talks strategy. 
"Spain's problem is competitiveness and provincialism. 
We need to cut costs and project ourselves abroad," he says. 
The merger will help with costs, he says, and plants may be built in North Africa. 
"We must take the offense in order to defend ourselves." 

   It will have to be a come-from-behind defense, because much of the rest of the world is already here. 
On a patch of dusty brown country 12 miles northwest of Madrid sits Spain's entree to the world of high technology, a sprawling $220 million structure in which American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Spain's Telefonica will make ultra-sophisticated microchips for Europe's future phones, cars and computers. 
The plant has the cleanest room in Europe, 100,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room, boasts an AT&amp;T official. 
Behind glass, technicians in what look like spacesuits test chip-making equipment. 
On the other side of the glass, high-speed Spanish mingles with American drawls as engineers confer in cubicles decorated with Miro posters and Green Bay Packers pennants. 

   "Spain is a little like the California of Europe," says Mr. Martorell, head of sales and marketing for the chip venture. 
He should know: He spent 14 years in Silicon Valley before coming home. 
He gestures out at AT&amp;T's man-made lake. 
"We've got the climate, nice surroundings, a well-trained work force." 
Like most foreign companies investing here, AT&amp;T, which owns 80% of the venture, will use Spain as a base for the European market. 
It hopes to sell 85% of its production elsewhere in Europe. 
Having a Spanish plant also protects against any possible post-1992 European requirement for high "local content" in technology sold here. 
"We're local," says Mr. Martorell. 

   Local, too, are Sanyo of Japan, Goldstar of South Korea, Fiat of Italy, and hundreds of other multinationals that are entering Europe-1992 through Spain-1988. 
General Electric of the U.S. said last month it will invest $1.7 billion in a plastics and silicon-sealants factory in Cartagena. 
A giant contract to build a high-speed train network will go to either French, German or Japanese companies. 
"On one level, 1992 is being played out among the multinationals," says Francesc Santacana i Martorell, coordinator of Barcelona 2000, a planning group. 
"Spain doesn't have any." 

   Instead of vainly trying to develop multinationals 30 years too late, argues Mr. Santacana at countless animated meetings, Spain should make a virtue of preparing the playing field. 
"We need to develop and coordinate dozens, hundreds, thousands of small and medium-sized suppliers to the AT&amp;Ts and Sonys of the world," he says, sketching interlaced star patterns on a sheet of paper. 
"We can sell them parts, we can offer them skilled labor, we can build their roads and clean their factories." 
To do this properly, he continues, now drawing concentric circles, requires one largely missing ingredient: home-grown entrepreneurs. 
"That's where Italy is ahead of us. 
They've got famous guys like De Benedetti and Agnelli. 
We don't." 

   Spain may soon have its own famous entrepreneurs, in part thanks to Italy. 
Jose Ramon Alvarez Rendueles is the head of Corp. Financiera Reunida SA, or Cofir, the private investment arm of Carlo De Benedetti. 
Like Mr. De Benedetti's Cerus SA unit in France, which led the wild and ultimately unsuccessful charge at Societe Generale de Belgique earlier this year, Cofir is supposed to shake up the Iberian business scene. 

   A former governor of the Spanish Central Bank, Mr. Rendueles has started fast: In its first year Cofir has bought stakes in a fruit company called Pascual Hermanos, a health-insurance company called Sanitas, and N.H. Hoteles, a hotel chain. 
It is looking next at Portugal, he says. 
"Spain's future is as a services economy, like everywhere else in the modern world. 
We'll never compete in steel, but we've got plenty of competitive advantages in agriculture, in taking care of our people's health and in welcoming more and more tourists." 

   Cofir's hotel investments so far are aimed at business people. 
Others are thinking about vast retirement communities for sun-starved Scandinavians and British. 
"After 1992 people will be able to retire here as easily as at home," says Mr. Santacana. 
He figures that a West German insurance company could sell a pension offering not just a steady income but also a home in Spain. 
"We're Europe's Sun Belt," he says. 
"The only difference between Spain and California is the freeways. 
And we're building those." 

   Spanish business strategists even think the country could emulate high-fashion Italy, transforming the shoes and clothing it now turns out cheaply. 
This would require a change in mentality, both in designers and in shoppers. 
There is an elegant men's shop in Barcelona that features brightly colored sweaters, expensive broadcloth shirts and highly styled blue blazers. 
The shop and its merchandise could have been flown in from Milan. 
It calls itself Massimo Dutti. 

   "It makes me furious," says a Barcelona businessman. 
"These guys come from a 400-year-old Spanish family and make this stuff 10 miles from Barcelona. 
Massimo Dutti? 
You'll know Spain has really arrived in Europe when they call the shop Pedro Martinez."

   First RepublicBank Corp. said it agreed in principle to sell its data processing unit to NCNB Texas National Bank for $55 million. 

   The agreement ends what was shaping up to be a nasty fight between First RepublicBank, the remaining shell of the big Texas banking concern, and NCNB Texas, the banking company that took over management of First RepublicBank's banks in a federally assisted bailout. 
It also apparently resolves a major hang-up in NCNB Corp.'s plan to buy a 20% stake in the banks it has been operating for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

   NCNB Texas, a unit of NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., apparently didn't realize when it took control of the banks in July that the banks' operations workers were employed by First RepublicBank Services Co., which remained with the holding company. 
NCNB managed the unit until an interim agreement expired Oct. 31 and then hired away 3,300 employees, including tellers, check processors, cash management workers and wire transfer employees. 
First RepublicBank responded with a lawsuit, charging unfair business practices and malicious conduct. 

   NCNB Texas said the agreement calls for the companies to halt litigation while negotiations continue and to drop the litigation when the transaction is completed. 
Terms of the agreement also call for NCNB Texas to manage the unit until the purchase is completed. 

   The sale must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court. 
First RepublicBank is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

   First RepublicBank, which has no connection with First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, said the agreement doesn't include the data processing unit's correspondent banking business, which will be sold separately. 
NCNB said it isn't bidding on that business. 

   An NCNB Texas spokesman said the transaction is "something we wanted to get resolved" before it purchased its 20% stake in the banks from the FDIC, but he wouldn't elaborate on whether the problem was a sticking point in completing the transaction. 
NCNB Corp. was expected to complete the purchase by the end of October, but now says it is making progress towards the purchase. 

   NCNB Corp. is supposed to pay $210 million for its stake and 100% voting control of NCNB Texas and the FDIC is supposed to make an additional equity infusion of $840 million. 
NCNB Corp. has five years to buy the remaining 80% from the FDIC.

<HL> Foreign Exchange: Dollar Drifts Lower Against Yen, Mark As Dealers Await September Trade Data </HL>

   Despite continued support by the Bank of Japan and attempts to talk it higher, the dollar drifted lower in quiet trading yesterday as the foreign-exchange market awaited today's announcement of U.S. September trade data. 

   Dealers describe the trade figures as crucial for the U.S. currency, and say the numbers may be the most important economic data for determining the direction of the dollar for the rest of the year. 

   Today "is a key day," said Michael Guarino, vice president and chief dealer with Algemene Bank NV in New York. 
"Everyone is expecting the deficit to be narrower than $12.2 billion." 

   The August U.S. trade deficit was announced at $12.18 billion after seasonal adjustment. 
A Dow Jones poll of 14 economists showed the average estimate of the September trade deficit to be $10.5 billion. 
Market players estimate a deficit of between $9.5 billion and $11 billion. 

   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.7428 marks, down from 1.7458 marks late Monday, and at 123.23 yen, down from 123.75 yen. 
The pound traded at $1.8088, down from $1.8090. 

   In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 123.58 yen, up from Tuesday's close of 123.25 yen. 

   Better-than-expected U.S. trade figures would help temper the overwhelmingly bearish market sentiment toward the dollar, Mr. Guarino said, but he warned that "if the market sees a double-digit deficit, you will have to hold onto your hat." 

   If there is a poor U.S. trade performance, he said the dollar would again be attacked by the market, and it would take concerted, heavy intervention by the central banks of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to restore stability. 
G-7 countries include the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada. 

   During Tuesday's Asian trading, the Bank of Japan continued to intervene in the open market by buying dollars at the 123.50-yen level and the 123.35-yen level. 
Tokyo dealers described the intervention efforts as small and probably aimed more at stabilizing the dollar-yen exchange rate than at pushing the dollar higher. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve wasn't spotted conducting open-market operations. 

   Also, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reiterated statements that G-7 central banks will continue to seek currency stability and would undertake cooperative intervention to achieve this goal. 

   The dollar received limited support from statements by Bank of England Gov. Robin Leigh Pemberton who said he thought it would be better if the dollar didn't fall and that there hasn't been any change in the exchange-rate policy of the G-7 nations since they last met in September. 

   Despite the jawboning, market rumors that the Fed would boost its discount rate proved to be more supportive of the dollar than statements by monetary officials. 
The rumor pushed the dollar to its intraday highs of 123.65 yen and 1.7490 marks before it came under selling pressure. 
Although traders decline to rule out the possibility of a discount-rate boost, the rumor eventually was shrugged off. 

   "A discount-rate hike is usually a last resort for the Fed," said John Lynam, vice president with Security Pacific International Bank in New York. 
"I would expect a tightening of Fed funds to 8.5% and then intervention (in the open market) before they would use a discount-rate hike." 

   Given the market's bearishness toward the dollar, traders say even a strong September trade performance may serve only to give the U.S. currency a slight boost before it resumes its downward trend. 

   The market remains bearish because of its suspicions that U.S. President-elect George Bush would like to see the dollar lower as part of his efforts to try to cure the twin U.S. trade and budget deficits. 

   Mr. Guarino said such feelings are reinforced by the fact that Mr. Bush and U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made supportive comments on the dollar only after stock and bond markets lost ground. 
He said the implication is that a lower dollar concerns Mr. Bush only when it threatens to disrupt capital and equity markets. 

   But Mr. Lynam said: "You have to look at the risk in a falling dollar. 
They (the central banks) won't be able to stop it if the market wants to sell the dollar." 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $424.40 an ounce, up 50 cents. 
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces. 

   In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $424.10 an ounce.

<HL> Money Managers With Smaller Stocks Hold Performance Lead, Study Shows </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>

   Money managers who loaded up on smaller stocks after the October 1987 crash remain among this year's top performing investment advisers despite these stocks' recent weakness, a survey showed. 

   For all managers, the typical stock portfolio showed a 14.1% gain in the first nine months of 1988, topping the 13% rise by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. 500-stock index, according to CDA Investment Technologies Inc., a Bethesda, Md., research firm that compiles performance data supplied by investment advisers. 
In the third quarter, managed portfolios typically showed no growth while the S&amp;P index inched up 0.3%. 

   Alan B. Lancz, president of a Toledo, Ohio, firm bearing his name with $40 million under management, was the top-ranked adviser in the nine months, largely on the strength of secondary stocks purchased after the crash. 
"I thought in December that a lot of these lower-priced stocks were once-in-a-lifetime buys," Mr. Lancz said. 

   Included in those purchases were five stocks that became involved in takeovers or restructurings, further pushing up their prices. 
Mr. Lancz, however, isn't wedded to smaller stocks, and in the second quarter, he found what he considered to be some better buys among issues such as drug maker Squibb Corp. 
More recently he has started nibbling again among smaller-capitalization issues, including CMS Enhancements Inc., a Tustin, Calif., maker of personal-computer peripheral equipment. 

   "We try to buy when we see bargains," Mr. Lancz said. 
"You can't chase stocks in a market like this. 
You have to buy when nobody else wants to buy and you have to sell when the market is moving up." 

   Larger money managers that were among the best performing in the first nine months also credit their results to small and medium-sized stocks. 
"After being out of favor since mid-1983, they outperformed the S&amp;P in the first quarter," said James Awad, president of BMI Capital Corp., which manages $500 million of assets. 
"The wind was at our back instead of our face." 

   An unusual number of takeovers and restructurings among BMI Capital's holdings, involving 21% of its portfolio early this year, also buoyed results. 
Mr. Awad says he isn't counting on a repeat of owning so many stocks involved in deals during such a short period. 

   Still, he thinks the firm's approach of looking for undervalued but fast-growing companies will do better than big-company stocks. 
"All our valuation work says the S&amp;P should underperform the market as a whole" for several years, he says. 

   Carmel, Calif.-based Neumeier Investment Counsel, which specializes in undervalued secondary issues, also credits decisions made late last year for its 1988 performance, but says the pickings have become slimmer of late. 

   "Maybe it's being spoiled because at this time last year there was so much to choose from," said Peter Neumeier, president of the firm, which has about 35% of the firm's $6 million under management in cash. 
"There are a lot of decent prices, but nothing that's really outstanding. 
We've taken profits {on stocks} and just haven't been able to replace them," he said. 

   Another strong performer among money managers in the first nine months was Pension Management Co. of Houston, which doesn't focus on a particular equity type for its $50 million portfolio. 
"We don't care if it's a growth stock, a turnaround, undervalued or whatever," said John Lee, president. 
"It doesn't make a difference." 

   Instead, the firm's approach is to apply to all stocks a mathematical equation, the makeup of which Mr. Lee says is proprietary but which he says can isolate one or two issues a month having qualities making a price rise predictable. 
All issues are assigned a sale date of either six months or a year when they're purchased. 
"We sell stocks by time, rather than price or news items," Mr. Lee said. 

   The best-performing bond fund in the CDA rankings for the nine months was also Toledo's Lancz Associates, with an 18.7% rate of return. 
Mr. Lancz said the firm holds less than $4 million in fixed-income investments, but that the sector had attracted increased interest among his clients since the stock market crash.

   Northern Trust Corp. said its board authorized formation of a so-called leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan to buy about 9% of the Chicago banking concern's common stock. 

   The plan would use borrowings of as much as $75 million to buy as many as 1.5 million newly issued and treasury shares. 
Yesterday, Northern shares closed at $44.50 each, up 87.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading. 

   In part to offset the issuance of those shares, Northern said its board also authorized the purchase of as many as one million of its common shares on the open market during the next two years. 

   The employee stock plan will replace a company-funded investment plan.

<TEXT>
   A group of Interco Inc. shareholders filed a lawsuit against the company and its board alleging securities-law violations in connection with Interco's avoidance of a hostile tender offer. 

   The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages and class-action status. 
The plaintiffs allege the St. Louis-based maker of well-known consumer brands such as Ethan Allen furniture and London Fog rainwear breached its fiduciary duties. 

   The suit alleges Interco and its directors, in rejecting the $2.47 billion, or $64-a-share, takeover proposal last July by the Rales brothers of Washington, were denying Interco shareholders the use of the $2.47 billion. 
The plaintiffs also allege the board is refusing to negotiate to maximize shareholder value and that the board authorized golden parachute severance agreements valued at $18 million when the Raleses became interested in acquiring Interco. 

   Interco said it hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment. 

   The plaintiffs are Mel Klein, Miriam Sarnoff, Frederick Rand, Ingeborg Kahlenberg, Harry Lewis, Moise Katz, the estate of Nathan Wolfe, Bernice Kahn, Richard Scwarzschild, Leonard Barkan, Helen Sutin, Kenneth Steiner, David Seinfeld and Herbert Behrens. 

   Interco co-defendants named in the suit were Harvey Saligman, chairman and chief executive officer; Harry M. Krogh, president and chief operating officer; Ronald L. Aylward, vice chairman; and four vice presidents, R. Stuart Moore, Mark H. Lieberman, Richard B. Loynd and Charles J. Rothschild Jr. Other Interco directors named in the suit are Zane E. Barnes, Donald E. Lasater, Lee M. Liberman, Robert H. Quenon, William E. Cornelius, Marilyn S. Lewis and Thomas H. O'Leary.

<HL> Credit Markets: Short-Term Rates Post a Further Big Advance On Technical Factors, Speculation About Fed </HL>

   Short-term interest rates surged again yesterday, partly because of technical factors but also because of growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit soon. 

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills rose for the seventh session in a row. 
Rates also increased on bank certificates of deposit and on federal funds, which are overnight loans between banks. 
In the long-term bond market, though, prices generally finished little changed. 

   The federal funds rate has been distorted this week by technical factors involving "Chips," the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, a computerized network for the transfer of international dollar payments. 
For example, the funds rate soared to as high as 30% at one point Monday and averaged 8.95% for the day, up from its recent range of about 8 1/4% to 8 3/8%. 

   Also, yesterday was the settlement date for about $30 billion of Treasury notes and cash management bills sold by the government last week. 
In addition, today is the final day of the latest two-week reporting period in which banks must meet their reserve positions with the Federal Reserve. 
The funds rate often climbs near the end of these periods. 

   But even when these technical factors disappear, many analysts still expect rates to continue rising. 
They predict the Federal Reserve will tighten its credit hold further to support the dollar in the currency markets and fight inflation fears. 

   The dollar faces a major test today when the government releases its monthly trade report. 
In the long-term bond market yesterday, prices generally were little changed as traders awaited the September trade report. 
Many analysts expect the report to show a narrower deficit than the $12.2 billion gap in August. 

   "I think we're headed toward higher interest rates by year end," said Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., bond market forecasting and advisory service. 
He said many investors won't buy long-term bonds now because they can get nearly the same yields on much shorter-term issues with far less price volatility. 

   For example, three-year Treasury notes as of late yesterday yielded about 8.69%. 
That's less than a third of a percentage point below the approximately 9% yield available on 30-year Treasury bonds. 
"I don't think there's enough incentive to investors to reach out and buy long-term Treasurys" at 9%, Mr. Froehlich said. 

   These concerns come as the government is planning to sell $9 billion of new 30-year Treasury bonds. 
The auction will be held tomorrow. 

   "We don't prefer any kind of long issues at this time. 
We're staying relatively short," said Thomas Barry, senior executive vice president at George D. Bjurman Associates in Los Angeles. 
Citing the narrow gap between short-term and long-term rates, he said, "You're not getting paid" enough to invest in long-term bonds. 

   Treasury Securities
   Short-term Treasury bill rates rose about 1/8 of a percentage point as the gap between short-term and long-term rates narrowed further. 

   The latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted late in the day at 7.94% bid, up from an average rate of 7.82% set at Monday's auction by the government. 
The latest six-month bill rate rose to 7.96% from 7.87% at Monday's auction. 

   These Treasury bill rates are "discount" rates. 
On a bond-equivalent basis, the latest three-month bill yields about 8.21%, while six-month bills offer about 8 3/8%. 

   In the long-term sector, prices of Treasury bonds fell early yesterday but later rebounded, finishing slightly lower than late Monday. 
The morning slump came after the government reported that retail sales rose 0.9% last month. 
That was three times as large an increase as many analysts had expected and added to inflation fears. 

   The government's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 were quoted at a price of 101 5/32. 
That was down only 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount, from 101 9/32 Monday. 
The yield rose to 9.01% from 9%. 

   Among other benchmark issues, the government's new 10-year notes fell slightly to 99 23/32 from 99 26/32, while the yield rose to 8.92% from 8.90%. 

   An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. declined 1.30 points to 1245.83. 
It ranged between 1240.83 and 1247.16. 
The total return so far this year on the bonds in the index is 7.88%; that includes both price changes and interest income. 

   The new 30-year bonds to be auctioned tomorrow were quoted in when-issued trading late yesterday at 8.98%. 

   The bond market outlook depends heavily on how the dollar reacts to the trade report today, many traders agreed. 
The September trade deficit is expected to have narrowed to $10.5 billion from August's $12.2 billion, according to the average estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

   Foreign Bonds
   Japanese and West German government bonds were little changed, while British government bonds drifted slightly lower. 

   In Tokyo, several Japanese investors said they will mostly stay away from the U.S. Treasury's 30-year bond auction unless the September trade gap shows a big improvement. 

   "A 9% yield by itself seems to be attractive, but because of great uncertainties over the dollar, we would rather not participate in the auction," said Seiki Naito, manager of the international department at Nomura Investment Trust Management Co., an affiliate of Nomura Securities Co. 

   The new 30-year Treasury bonds yield nearly 4 1/2 percentage points more than the Japanese bellwether 10-year government bond. 
That issue closed yesterday in Tokyo at a yield of 4.575%, up 0.5 basis point on the day. 
That represented a price of 102.72, down 0.03 yen for each 100 yen face value. 

   "I can't say how the {U.S. 
Treasury bond} auction will go before we see the trade balance and the dollar's reaction," said Fujio Matsuki, chief securities trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. 

   Unless the trade gap is much narrower than expected, Nomura's Mr. Naito said, buying opportunities for Treasurys are likely to be much better in the secondary market. 
"There could be the chance to get the bonds much cheaper there," he said. 
"Basically, we won't be active players in Treasurys unless we confirm a concrete bottoming out of the dollar." 

   Other Japanese investors agree, saying they are waiting to see how the new U.S. administration copes with the trade and budget deficits. 

   In London, long-term government bonds, known as gilts, lost about half a point amid fear that another increase in U.K. base rates is coming. 

   Investors also are nervous ahead of the release of the U.S. trade data. 
This is widely expected to overshadow any new U.K. domestic developments. 
Dealers said gilts will probably follow any reaction in the U.S. Treasury bond market rather than track any movements in the pound in response to the U.S. data. 

   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 ended 16/32 point lower at 115 31/32 to yield 9.65%. 

   In West Germany, prices of government bonds hardly moved from their opening levels. 
Bonn's benchmark 6 3/4% issue due August 1998 finished unchanged at 102.65 to yield 6.375% in thin dealings. 
Little demand also was seen in the 6 3/8% federal railway issue launched Monday, which was quoted late yesterday at a yield of 6.58%. 

   Mortgage-Backed Issues
   Prices of Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities were 2/32 to 1/4 point weaker for the session, despite a late firming in prices as dealers squared positions before the trade report. 

   Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities for November delivery were bid at 97 25/32 late, for a bond equivalent yield of about 9.70%, assuming a 12-year average life. 
That brings the mortgage securities to a spread of 105.6 basis points over the benchmark Treasury 10-year note. 

   Prices of Ginnie Maes slid in early dealings in line with Treasurys on a larger than expected advance in October retail sales and, although traders say bids were strong at the lower levels, the market was unable to fully recover. 

   Anticipation of the merchandise trade deficit report put a damper on activity. 

   "There were long stretches of time when nothing traded," said one participant. 

   Elsewhere in the mortgage market, Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities were at 98, down 2/32, and Freddie Mac 9 1/2% securities were at 97 18/32, also down 2/32. 

   Municipal Bonds
   Municipal bonds finished mixed in light activity. 

   Active issues were quoted from 1/8 point weaker to 1/4 point higher for the session. 
Prices fell in the morning as investors reacted to the unexpectedly large advance in October retail sales. 

   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018, for example, were quoted at 94 1/2 bid, unchanged from Monday's close after hitting a low of 94 1/4 in early trading. 
The yield stands at about 7.66%. 

   Traders say that both the trade report and the Treasury's forthcoming 30-year bond auction are keeping investors on the sidelines in the municipal secondary market. 

   In the new-issue arena, investors gave a warm reception to a two-part issue by the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust, according to underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
The trust took bids for a total of about $101 million of wastewater treatment bonds. 

   Corporate Issues
   Prices were generally little changed to 1/8 point lower in light trading. 

   On the new issue front, Specialty Equipment Cos. offered $150 million of 12-year senior subordinated debentures through Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 

   The debentures were priced at par to yield 13.75%, at the high end of the price talk range. 

   The issue is noncallable for five years. 
The initial call price is 105.20. 
The yield at the initial call price would be about 14.50%.

   Advance Circuits Inc. said it is considering the sale, merger or restructuring of the company, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., and has hired the investment banking firm of William Blair &amp; Co. to review its options. 

   The maker of printed circuits, which said it isn't currently engaged in discussions with other companies, said the current softness in the market for low capital value stocks makes it an appropriate time to explore ways to enhance shareholder value. 

   Advance Circuits added that its recent decision to terminate its California operations, while resulting in a large write-down, didn't impede its cash flow. 
The restructuring of debt in 1987 and cash flow generated from operations in 1988 and 1989 will allow the company to maintain a strong financial position, the company said. 
In national over-the-counter trading, Advance Circuits closed at $3.625, up 75 cents.

   One of the strangest courtroom spectacles of modern times is scheduled for Friday. 
The government will file a friend-of-the-court brief blasting the government's own criminal prosecution. 
This could never happen under normal circumstances because a prosecutor who violated Justice Department policies would be taken off the case and probably fired. 

   But never is now, because the prosecutor is Lawrence Walsh, conducting his case against Lt. Col. Oliver North. 
With a trial scheduled to begin soon if difficulties over use of classified materials can be resolved, Mr. Walsh last month finally explained the legal theories he's relying on in several hundred pages of briefs. 
His arguments against dismissing the most important charges, including Count One's conspiracy charge, de pend on legal positions entirely inconsistent with many long-held views of the executive branch. 

   The Justice Department last week warned the judge in the case, Gerhard Gesell, that Mr. Walsh "mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of separation of powers and executive branch authority," and noted that no one in the executive branch "had an opportunity to review or respond" before Mr. Walsh's legal arguments were filed. 
Mr. Walsh responded that he "rejects the suggestion that {he} mischaracterized the law," and "strongly opposes this wholly unjustified, 11th hour motion." 

   Mr. Walsh is an independent counsel, but the statute creating these special prosecutors says they "shall, except where not possible, comply with the written or other established policies of the Department of Justice with respect to the enforcement of criminal laws." 
If an independent counsel refuses, he can be dismissed for "misconduct." 

   Executive-branch officials are especially angry about the positions Mr. Walsh took suggesting that Congress is superior to the executive branch in conducting foreign policy. 
Abraham Sofaer, legal adviser at the State Department, sent a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh suggesting a response to the Walsh filing. 
According to sources at several agencies involved in the controversy, lawyers at the White House then helped organize the prospective filing against Mr. Walsh, which was joined enthusiastically by the Justice, State and Defense departments, the National Security Council, the National Security Agency and the CIA. 

   It's not hard to see what has all these agencies so exercised. Here are some of the arguments that the Justice Department brief should declare out of bounds:
   Congress, not the president, has the major say in foreign policy. 
In defending the constitutionality of the Boland amendments, Mr. Walsh makes the flat assertion that "the Founders believed that Congress should have the ultimate authority in this area {of foreign and military affairs}." 
The more accepted view is the precise opposite. 
The Federalist Papers stress how the Constitution invigorated the earlier feeble executive by making the president the commander in chief. 
As Lt. Col. North's lawyers note (citing a study that originally appeared in this space last year), presidents have sent troops or war materiel abroad more than 100 times without any congressional authorization. 

   Mr. Walsh dismisses the leading Supreme Court case on this subject, U.S. v. 
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. (1936), which referred to the "very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations." 
This especially outrages the Justice Department, where lawyers in separation-of-powers disputes over foreign policy for 50 years have relied on the phrase, "Curtiss-Wright, so we're right." 

   Congress's power is so supreme that executive-branch officials can go to jail for violating laws Congress might have passed. 
A huge stumbling block to the Walsh prosecution is the ambiguous and possibly unconstitutional Boland amendments. 
The first question is whether they applied to the National Security Council staff and thus Lt. Col. North. 
We now know that President Reagan never thought so. 
"The President's Intelligence Oversight Board (PIOB) delivered their annual report to me on September 13, 1985," President Reagan wrote, responding to questions from Mr. Walsh. 
"That report, which our records reflect I saw, concluded that the Boland Amendment did not apply to the activities of the NSC staff." 

   This is the only interpretation of the Boland amendments by the executive branch, yet Mr. Walsh mysteriously dismisses the PIOB opinion simply as "discredited," though he doesn't say by whom. 
He also ignores the fact that Lt. Col. North relied on this view, which would make it hard to prove he intended to violate the law. 
Mr. Walsh also argues that the Boland amendments would be constitutional if they did apply to the president's staff. 
That conflicts with one of the most fundamental principles of U.S. law, that Congress is powerless to limit through statute the president's constitutional powers. 

   Mr. Walsh may suspect he will lose both these arguments. He makes the further argument that whatever the status of the Boland amendments, the statute on "conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government" makes it a crime "even when the wrongdoers violate no specific substantive criminal statute." In other words, it's a crime to "conspire" to commit a non-violation if that non-violation is something Congress might later outlaw. The following dumbfounded many lawyers throughout the executive branch:
   "Even if it were the case that the activities of North and his co-conspirators had fallen within some sort of loophole in the Boland Amendment, or were found not to violate specific provisions of the structure of legal control over covert action, the broader problem with their deceitful activities would remain: the defendants, aware of a clearly expressed congressional statutory effort to limit and closely monitor funding for the contras, chose to hide their activities from Congress to ensure that Congress would not have the opportunity to consider whether to close any such loophole." 

   This is a mind-boggling theory of criminalization. 
Under the Anglo-American system, crimes are supposed to be defined with precision, not by what Congress might do. 
The Walsh view is more reminiscent of the Soviet crime of "hooliganism," with its definition changing with the political winds. 
This analogy is no exaggeration. 
Proposals for a total ban on aid to the Contras lost in both the House and Senate. 
Mr. Walsh ignores the fact that the Boland amendments were compromises that everyone at the time understood would leave the president and his NSC discretion to keep the Contras going until Congress passed new aid. 

   Congress doesn't have just oversight powers over the president, but supervisory powers as well. 
Consider this sentence from Mr. Walsh: "Although Congress has not seen fit to prohibit covert operations, it has put in place requirements of reporting and accountability that enable it to exercise substantive control over particular operations when it should prove necessary." 
Mr. Walsh assumes that Congress could prohibit covert operations, a debatable proposition. 
He also assumes Congress can exercise "substantive control," despite the president's dual role as commander in chief and chief executive. 

   In another section, Mr. Walsh criticizes the defendants for trying to "thwart the normal processes of constitutional government by acting unilaterally." 
Such actions might be an affront to a system of legislative supremacy, but not to our system of checks and balances. 
The president and his staff often act without prior congressional approval and even with congressional opposition, on matters from negotiating treaties (beginning with President Washington) to transferring battleships to endangered allies (Franklin Roosevelt in 1941) to dispatching the Marines (innumerable occasions from Jefferson to Reagan). 

   At another point, Mr. Walsh suggests that Congress could prohibit the president himself from soliciting funds for groups like the Contras from other heads of state or from private citizens. 
He also repeats the charge that it's a crime for a charity to raise funds to buy arms, despite the contrary position taken by officials at the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department itself. 
In contrast to the rather scholarly arguments on behalf of separation of powers in the North briefs, the Walsh briefs are sprinkled with references to a "secret slush fund" and a "secret war." 

   In a sense, this deep conflict between the executive branch and Mr. Walsh is simply another sign of the perversity of "independent" counsel. 
But it also matters that Lt. Col. North is now being tried based on charges that no normal federal prosecutor would bring. 
This makes equal treatment under the law a joke for accused executive-branch officials. 
This lesson will not be ignored by future officials, who will fear that pursuing executive-branch policies could mean risking prison. 

   This prosecution also runs the real risk of new judicial rulings that adopt a view of the "government" -- here Mr. Walsh -- that would redefine the relative positions of the executive and legislative branches in foreign policy. 
The system we had before Iran-Contra was not perfect, and certainly the executive branch needs to tighten its own self-regulation, but any system that gives Congress control over foreign policy is a guarantee of paralysis. 

   President Reagan has the ultimate power to call off the entire case by issuing pardons. 
The Walsh briefs strengthen the likelihood of such a move by highlighting the weakness of the prosecution. 
Whether President Reagan will issue pardons could depend on how much he cares about protecting the powers of the presidency.

<TEXT>
   Video Superstores of America Inc. said its three largest shareholders will convert five million shares of common stock into an equal number of new convertible preferred, reducing the common shares outstanding by 43%. 

   A spokesman said the plan, which will reduce shares outstanding to 6.5 million from 11.5 million, is meant to improve the company's ratio of prices to earnings and make it more attractive to current shareholders. 

   Video, a owner and operator of video rental stores based in Hollywood, Fla., said the preferred stock has the same voting rights as the common. 
The company said the three shareholders, company president Ben Derrickson, Robert J. Weiss, a director, and Thomas Smith, an investor, will be able to reconvert their five million shares of preferred to common under certain conditions.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc., White Plains, N.Y., said it intends to expand its program to sell certain oil-and-gas reserves, even though the program is proceeding slower than anticipated. 

   James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive officer, told analysts in White Plains that the company expects to sell the properties in smaller lots over a longer period of time than originally called for under a major restructuring program. 
A glut of such properties has been on the market, including the oil and gas reserves of Houston-based Tenneco Inc. 

   Other company officials added that in 1989, Texaco expects to sell roughly 160 million barrels of reserves, up from the 60 million barrels that company had planned to shed during the year. 
Texaco recently has been receiving the equivalent of $4.76 for each barrel of oil and gas reserves it has been selling, a company spokesman added. 

   The Texaco officials reiterated the company's intention to distribute to shareholders about one-third of the $5 billion that the company expects to raise as part of its asset-shedding program.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported third-quarter net income rose 14% to $97 million, or $5.81 for each share of participating preferred stock. 

   A year ago, Freddie Mac, which was established by Congress to operate a secondary market for mortgage loans, posted net income of $85 million, or $5.11 a share. 
"The corporation made significant strides in mortgage product and securities development during the quarter," said Leland Brendsel, president and chief executive officer. 
He listed a number of new programs, including a program to purchase Equal loans, which provide borrowers with lower initial loan payments. 

   The company, based in Reston, Va., said that taxes in the latest quarter were calculated at a lower rate, reflecting the reduction in the federal income tax rate. 
Freddie Mac said it purchased $11.9 billion of mortgage loans in the latest quarter and sold $11.6 billion of mortgage-related securities. 
That's down from purchases of $16.6 billion and sales of $15.7 billion the year before. 

   Earlier this year, the board of the federally chartered corporation voted to allow public ownership of Freddie Mac's preferred shares. 
Currently, the preferred stock is held by thrift institutions that are members of the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, while the common shares are held by the regional Home Loan Banks. 

   Public trading of the preferred stock begins in January. 

   For the nine months, Freddie Mac reported income of $284 million, or $17.11 a share of participating preferred stock, up 27% from $224 million, or $13.49 a share a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Louisiana regulators said that Gulf States Utilities Co. should designate a disputed $1.4 billion in nuclear-plant costs as a deregulated asset, and exclude it from its rate base. 

   The Louisiana Public Service Commission in its order reiterated its view that $1.4 billion of the plant's costs were imprudent, and also proposed reducing the company's allowed return on equity to 12.75% from its current 14% and postponing a March rate increase approved by a state court until Sept. 30. 

   Michael Fontham, special counsel for the commission, said the order sets out a plan that would protect ratepayers while resolving financial and legal difficulties stemming from the $4.5 billion River Bend nuclear project. 
The proposed settlement could help Gulf States avoid a huge write-off of River Bend assets, Mr. Fontham said. 

   The embattled utility holding company has 10 days to respond to the commission's order, which came after a Louisiana judge asked regulators to again review issues involving River Bend. 
If Gulf States rejects the proposal, the case goes back to the Louisiana court. 

   A spokeswoman for Gulf States said company officials were reviewing the order and had no immediate comment. 
The utility has frequently in the past appealed regulatory decisions in court, seeking ways around Louisiana's tight-fisted regulators. 

   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Gulf States shares closed at $9, up 50 cents.

<TEXT>
   BP America Inc., the U.S. affiliate of British Petroleum Co., posted an 11% drop in its third-quarter operating profit, to $548 million from $619 million a year earlier, as earnings slid sharply in its exploration and production business. 

   Operating profit for the petroleum operation's exploration and production business declined 43% to $319 million from $559 million. 
That decrease more than offset improved results for the Cleveland company's other units. 

   Operating profit for the petroleum operation's refining and marketing business more than doubled, rising to $169 million from $74 million. 
Operating profit for the minerals segment increased to $82 million from $24 million, and to $17 million from $5 million for the chemical business. 

   Capital spending increased 8.8% in the quarter to $468 million from $430 million, with the exploration and production sector accounting for about half of the outlays in both periods. 

   During the third quarter, contract prices for the company's Alaskan crude oil averaged $14.06 a barrel, down from $18.63 a barrel in the year-ago quarter.

<HL> Economy: City of the Angels' Growth May Spawn Devilish Problems --- Los Angeles 2000 Study Says Boom May Bring About Smog-Bound Nightmare </HL>
<AUTHOR> David J. Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The booming economy of this city and its environs will continue into the first decade of the next century, creating three million new jobs as the population swells 35% to 18.1 million, a new study says. 

   The study also foresees a smog-bound urban nightmare of crawling traffic and horrendous housing and education conditions if steps to mitigate growth-related problems aren't taken now. 

   The study by the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, a group of more than 150 civic and business leaders, identifies future threats to a five-county area of Southern California and offers a wish-list of solutions, including:
   --New transportation and freeway projects costing $16.3 billion. 

   --A nonprofit housing trust fund, financed by corporations and others, to help build $4 billion to $12 billion of housing needed to stop the flight away from the city's job-rich center. 

   --A $4.8 billion project over the next 30 years to increase by 250% the capacity of the city's ports, already the nation's busiest. 

   --A more-holistic environmental master plan, replacing current piecemeal approaches to problems in this heavily polluted area. 

   --A radical move toward regional government to attack traffic, smog and other ills that cross city boundaries. 

   The fastest-growing sector of Southern California's economy -- with $290 billion of goods and services that already ranks it 11th in the world if calculated as gross national product -- will remain business and professional services, including banking, insurance and real estate. 

   The report predicted vast ethnic divisions as the population mix changes. 
No group will represent a majority by 2010, with Hispanics and whites each making up about 40%. 
Hispanic and black workers will continue to fill technical and craft jobs in manufacturing, more vulnerable to plant closings, changing technology and closures from environmental regulations. 
A growing Asian minority is pictured as increasingly taking professional positions in electronics and banking industries. 

   To help close the gap of an evolving "bimodal" work force between high-skill and low-skill workers, more literacy programs were recommended, along with expanded partnerships linking business with school programs and increased minority-teacher recruitment. 

   Crime, identified as the worst problem here, would be attacked by a county-court reorganization and a reform of the sentencing system, along with $300 million spent on education and child care.

<HL> Commodities: Soybean Futures Prices Fall Sharply on Selling By Commercial Trading Firms, Rain in Brazil </HL>
<AUTHOR> Scott McMurray (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> CMD PCS MIN PET </IN>
<TEXT>
   A flood of selling by commercial trading companies in Chicago's trading pits and scattered showers in the midst of Brazil's planting season swept soybean futures prices sharply lower in active trading. 

   The contract for January 1989 delivery of soybeans fell 13.5 cents to $7.58 a bushel. 

   Several commercial trading companies sold soybean futures on the belief that "significant export business isn't in the cards over the near term," said Joel Karlin, a futures analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. 
Several soybean-importing countries are believed to be angry that they bought soybeans near their highs this summer as drought fears sent prices skyrocketing, traders said. 

   "Importers think they'll get it cheaper if they hold out a little longer," Mr. Karlin said. 
Traders' hopes that the Russians are coming to buy more soybeans and grains were dashed again yesterday as no news surfaced as to the Soviets' commodity shopping list. 
U.S. and Soviet negotiators haven't yet set a date for concluding talks on renewing the five-year grain pact that expired Sept. 30. 
Certain analysts had speculated that a new multimillion ton pact might be forged as early as next week. 

   Trading companies as well as professional speculators also sold soybeans futures as the contracts plunged to their lowest levels since late July, when the drought-inspired speculative price bubble burst. 
Futures traders often set predetermined price levels at which point they sell their contracts to avoid further losses. 

   Rains in central and northern Brazil as that major soybean exporting country's planting season shifts into high gear depressed soybean futures prices, said Dale Gustafson, a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago. 
Analysts see a large soybean crop from Brazil as weighing heavily on prices U.S. producers will be able to get for their future exports. 

   Corn and wheat futures prices came tumbling after soybean futures prices, though the decline wasn't as pronounced in either grain. 
Farmers, apparently unnerved by falling commodity prices, stepped up their corn sales in the eastern Corn Belt, Mr. Gustafson said. 
These cash market sales added to the downward price spiral by depressing futures prices still further, he said. 

   No news on export sales also was bad news for corn and wheat futures prices, analysts said. 

   In other commodity markets yesterday:
   COPPER: Futures prices plunged despite continued labor problems in Peru and a bullish outlook for supply and demand. 
The December contract fell 6.10 cents a pound to $1.2990, recovering slightly from a low of $1.2950. 
In Peru, an estimated 5,000 miners were reported to have taken over three churches to express their demands, an analyst said, quoting a news report. 
He said the government isn't recognizing the miners' claims and it isn't proposing anything. 
Analysts said the market has simply been overbought and is long overdue for a correction after the December-delivery contract rose from 86 cents in August to a life-of-contract high of $1.4820 on Nov. 3, without a significant retreat. 
"This made the market subject to profit-taking and technical correction," he said. 

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed. 
December gold was up 40 cents an ounce to $425.60. 
December silver declined 5.2 cents an ounce to $6.3930. 
January platinum advanced $1.70 an ounce to $578.20. 
Some early strength developed on news of a larger-than-expected increase in U.S. retail sales during October. 
But weakness in crude oil prompted late selling in precious metals, according to an analyst. 

   ENERGY: Futures prices declined in anticipation that American Petroleum Institute figures to be released after the close of trading yesterday would show a strong buildup in U.S. gasoline and crude oil stocks. 
However, decreases were actually reported, which are expected to give futures a boost today, at least at the beginning of trading. 
Gasoline futures attracted the most attention; the December contract ended with a loss of 1.20 cents a gallon at 46.96 cents. 
Heating oil for December shipment declined 0.23 cent a gallon to 44.40 cents. 
December crude oil was off 37 cents a barrel to $13.90. 
When the figures came out, stocks of gasoline for the week ended Friday were down 1.8 million gallons from the week before to 12 million. 
Crude oil stocks in the same week fell three million barrels to 336 million. 
Heating oil stocks also declined sharply, by 3.1 million gallons to 125 million. 
But in trading before the figures came out, December gasoline dropped sharply after a small early advance. 
One analyst said the expected increase in gasoline stocks was important because supplies for nearby delivery have been on the tight side recently partly because of a refiners' strike in Brazil. 
Late in the day, Texaco announced it plans to sell 160 million barrels of crude oil from its domestic oil reserves, up from 60 million it previously announced it would sell, an analyst said. 
This would increase the amount of crude oil being offered into the market, he said.

   Atari Corp., still having trouble digesting its acquisition of Federated Group Inc., saw third-quarter profit drop sharply even as sales rose 91%. 

   The maker of personal computers and electronic games, which bought Federated's chain of consumer electronics stores a year ago, said net income for the quarter ended Oct. 1 fell 91% to $901,000, or two cents a share, from $9.9 million, or 17 cents a share a year ago, which included a $1.6 million gain from tax-loss carry-forwards. 
Operating profit for the year-earlier quarter was $8.3 million, or 14 cents a share. 

   Third-qarter sales grew to $153.9 million from $80.4 million. 

   According to Sam Tramiel, Atari's president, computer sales were constrained by memory chip shortages, and margins were hurt by the weak dollar. 
Overall, the computer division had a pretax operating profit of $11.9 million, a decrease of 20% from the year-earlier quarter. 
The performance of the Federated stores, which had a pretax operating loss of $6.7 million for the quarter on sales of $56.9 million, was disappointing, he added. 

   For the nine months, Atari had profit of $12.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a 69% drop from the year earlier's net of $38.7 million, or 67 cents a share, including a gain of $13.3 million from tax-loss carryforwards. 
The year-earlier's operating profit was $25.5 million, or 43 cents a share. 

   Nine-month sales more than doubled to $487.8 million from $216.2 million.

<HL> Wanted: One Tough Cookie for Defense Secretary </HL>

<SO> </SO>
<IN> ARO </IN>
<G> EXE DEF </G>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush has told the American people that he favors deficit reductions, a strong defense and no new taxes. 
For such a blueprint to have a chance, his single most important appointment will be that of defense secretary. 

   Defense is central for a number of reasons. 
The sheer volume of dollars passing through the department annually -- close to $300 billion -- affects not only fiscal policy but also the business climate in whole sectors of American industry. 
The Pentagon also is involved in arms control, base treaties and other aspects of diplomacy. 

   Now a budget crisis looms at Defense. 
The department has locked itself into $300 billion to $500 billion in new spending over the next five years over and above the level it is even remotely likely to get under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. 
A wholly different source of cost pressure is the cost of "get-well" money for much of the military equipment that has been purchased -- ranging from the MX missile and B-1 bomber to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Beretta pistol. 
Still more upward pressure on costs comes from maintenance and support costs for the new equipment, costs that are rising much faster than Defense planned for. 

   The Bush administration faces a lose-lose proposition of shrinking forces at higher costs when fiscal pressures are greatest. 
The problem is exacerbated by all the "political engineering" of defense contracts -- spreading the money around in lots of congressional districts. 
This makes programs next to impossible to turn off, even when they produce substandard, obsolete or unnecessary products. 

   Moreover, the planning and budgeting process at Defense is so deeply flawed with consistently underestimated costs and consistently overestimated revenue that more money won't solve the problems. 

   Something, or rather a lot of somethings, are going to have to give. 

   One tough secretary of defense is called for. Mr. Bush will need someone who is:
   1.
Completely in his confidence. 
The president must trust the secretary's judgment and be willing to spend political capital backing his decisions. 

   2.
Politically conservative. 
Whoever's chosen needs to be ideologically comfortable with the president and his advisers. 

   3.
Aware of the pressures inside the Pentagon. 
Defense is not going to get out of the planning and budget crunch if the new secretary lacks insights into what got us into it. 

   4.
Ready to address, from day one, the Defense Department's unfunded commitments. 
The department has been making down payments on expensive programs for more than 10 years. 
These bills are coming due. 
The longer it takes to address this, the higher the bills will mount. 

   5.
Strongly committed to maintaining troop readiness. 
No "raiding" this part of the budget, creating a force that can't fight. 
Secretary Carlucci has had the right instincts on this issue. 

   6.
Willing to "just say no" and stick to it. 
Every branch of the service, nearly every Defense Department acquisition program and most major Pentagon activities have powerful constituencies that will work hard to block any cuts or terminations. 
The first time the secretary reverses a significant decision in the face of this pressure, the floodgates will open on every other decision. 
James Schlesinger was particularly strong in this "courage of his convictions" department. 

   7.
Experienced in the ways of Congress. 
Probably our best recent Pentagon chief was Melvin Laird, a former House member who understood the Defense Department-congressional nexus clearly. 
Another very good one was Clark Clifford, who had similar political skills. 
Among potential nominees mentioned, Rep. Dick Cheney and former Rep. Jack Edwards would fill this bill. 

   8.
Willing to hire a "turnaround" specialist from the business community as deputy secretary. 
The deputy holds the top operational job in the building. 
The job is going to require someone with Paul O'Neill, Ross Perot, John Sculley or Don Peterson-like skills at turning a big organization around and getting it to produce better "products and services" at lower costs. 
Recall David Packard under Mr. Laird. 

   9.
People-oriented. 
The greatest untapped assets at the Pentagon are the people who work for it. 
No one is more knowledgeable about problems inside the department. 
The trick is to develop as many channels of communication as possible up to the secretary, and then promote and encourage the people who are offering the most constructive advice. 

   One action the new secretary could take first thing to communicate a seriousness about getting the weapons capabilities that we have been paying for, and to crack down on poorly performing equipment, would be to select a director of operational test and evaluation who will do the job Congress mandated. 
Honest, rigorous weapons testing is fundamental if we are to seriously address the problem of unfunded purchasing commitments and the rising maintenance and repair costs. 
A tough weapons tester would clearly communicate, "If the equipment doesn't work, we're not buying it." 

   No one candidate for secretary will have all these qualities. 
But the key is having someone who understands that "business-as-usual" will greatly accelerate Pentagon problems. 
The worst choice would be someone who helped create the current problems in the department, or who has a major personal stake in some of the existing programs and practices. 

   ---
   Mr. Weiss is chairman of American Minerals Inc. and Business Executives for National Security.

<HL> Technology: Ashton-tate Gets Boost From Shipments Of dBASE but Will Delay New Software </HL>

<TEXT>
   Ashton-Tate Corp.'s long-delayed shipment of a new version of its flagship software product allowed it to post last-minute sales and profit gains in its fiscal third quarter. 

   Now there's another holdup in the works for an important product. 
Torrance, Calif.-based Ashton-Tate and Microsoft Corp. will announce today a more than three-month delay in delivery of a new program that enables networks of personal computers to easily tap databases on larger mainframe computer systems and minicomputers. 
The SQL Server, originally promised by the end of 1988, now will be shipped on or before April 10, 1989, according to a Microsoft spokeswoman. 

   Ashton-Tate, the third-largest maker of personal computer software, started delivering copies of its oft-delayed dBASE IV database manager program in the last week of its quarter that ended Oct. 31. 
While production snags limited the number of copies of the $800 program shipped, the company managed to ring up a 6% increase in profit to $11.7 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net of $11.1 million, or 44 cents a share. 
Revenue grew 11% to $75.7 million from the year earlier $68 million. 

   "It really came down to the wire," said David Readerman, a securities analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York who estimates that Ashton-Tate shipped 100,000 copies of dBASE IV in less than a week. 
"By shipping they were able to meet Wall Street's estimates, but if they had missed it would've been ugly." 

   The new database manager succeeds dBASE III, the most popular database program for International Business Machines Corp. and compatible personal computers. 
Ashton-Tate originally promised dBASE IV for sometime in July, and subsequently pushed it back to the end of September and then to the end of October. 

   Shipment of dBASE IV was crucial to Ashton-Tate, because database programs, which organize many forms of data including customer accounts, inventory, and mailing lists, historically have accounted for about 60% of the company's business. 
The remainder of Ashton-Tate's revenue comes from sales of word processor and page layout programs for the IBM market, as well as a small but growing portfolio of similar programs for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh personal computer. 

   In the third quarter, the bulge from shipments of dBASE IV meant that database sales accounted for more than 70% of Ashton-Tate's revenue. 
"From this quarter on," said Mr. Readerman, "Ashton-Tate will have to get back to its knitting on its other products," to be able to keep growing. 

   While the delayed shipping date of SQL Server adds to the growing list of major software projects failing to meet promised deadlines, analysts said it wouldn't harm the financial outlooks of either Ashton-Tate or Microsoft. 
"SQL Server is a product that won't really have an impact until 1990, because it is the beginning of a whole new approach for office computing and it will take a while to ramp up anyway," said Mr. Readerman of Shearson Lehman Hutton. 

   Besides, he added, the delivery deadlines weren't ever taken that seriously, "because SQL Server has been the product of a committee" rather than a single company. 
Sybase Inc., a closely held concern based in Berkeley, Calif., in which Apple holds a minority stake, is working along with Microsoft and Ashton-Tate to produce SQL Server. 

   For the nine months, Ashton-Tate's profit grew 13% to $34.3 million, or $1.32 a share, from the $30.3 million, or $1.20 a share in the year-earlier period. 
Revenue rose 15% to $220 million from the $191.8 million. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Ashton-Tate shares closed at $25.125, unchanged.

<HL> Two Firms Face Pentagon Fraud Case Charges --- Units of Emerson Electric And Teledyne Are Cited As Having Been Notified </HL>

   Federal prosecutors have notified units of Emerson Electric Co. and Teledyne Inc. that they face criminal charges stemming from the nationwide Pentagon procurement fraud and bribery investigation, according to law-enforcement officials and others with knowledge of the case. 

   Law-enforcement officials said that top Justice Department officials are reviewing recommendations from prosecutors to seek conspiracy charges against the Hazeltine Corp. subsidiary of St. Louis-based Emerson and the defense electronics unit of Los Angeles-based Teledyne. 

   They added that the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., Henry Hudson, who is directing the grand jury inquiry, also wants to seek charges against several former or current executives of the two concerns. 

   One law-enforcement official and others familiar with the inquiry said that if the grand jury, which is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow, isn't asked to return criminal charges this week, such action is likely to come in early December. 

   Hazeltine has acknowledged that it is a target of the much-publicized criminal inquiry and says that it is cooperating with the prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

   A Teledyne spokesman declined to comment. 

   Criminal charges against Hazeltine and the Teledyne unit would be the first growing out of the two-year investigation -- known as Operation Ill Wind -- into alleged bribery and influence peddling involving major Defense Department contractors, their employees and consultants. 

   Previously, it was reported that Mr. Hudson's staff had notified lawyers for two defense consultants -- William Parkin and Fred Lackner -- that indictments would be sought against their clients unless they agreed to plead guilty to bribery-related charges and cooperate with the government. 
Mr. Parkin worked as a consultant for Hazeltine and the Teledyne unit and shared his fees with Mr. Lackner. 

   Officials and others disclosed in the last few days that prosecutors also are considering charges against Stuart Berlin, a top Navy engineer and close friend of Mr. Lackner, in the conspiracy and bribery case. 
Investigators are looking into whether Mr. Lackner paid Mr. Berlin for providing him with inside information or steering business to Mr. Lackner's clients. 

   Messrs. 
Lackner and Parkin have denied bribing anyone, and Mr. Berlin repeatedly has declined comment. 

   Several persons familiar with the investigation said in the last few days that prosecutors are reviewing the activities of at least six current or former Teledyne executives, including Robert Hougardy, the president of the electronics unit; Layne Clark, a senior executive of the unit; and Michael Savaides, a former Washington marketing representative for the unit. 
The investigation also is reviewing the activities of Joseph Colarusso, executive vice president of Hazeltine, and Charles Furciniti, a former vice president of Hazeltine's Washington office. 

   Attorneys for all of the men declined to comment. 

   Two law-enforcement officials said that Mr. Hudson, the prosecutor, has handed Justice Department officials papers seeking approval for an indictment accusing Hazeltine, the Teledyne electronics unit, some officials of both entities, and Messrs. 
Parkin, Lackner and Berlin of engaging in a single, broad conspiracy. 

   These law-enforcement officials said prosecutors hope to show that Mr. Parkin and Mr. Lackner arranged to pay Mr. Berlin for information, which they passed on to Hazeltine and Teledyne. 
Some defense lawyers privately criticize the strategy of tying together Hazeltine and Teledyne in a single conspiracy, since they don't appear to have had any connection other than their use of Mr. Parkin as a consultant. 

   One defense lawyer called the single conspiracy theory an "unorthodox approach," while another described it as "startling." 

   Law-enforcement officials said, however, that Hazeltine and Teledyne may instead be named in separate conspiracies involving Messrs. 
Parkin, Lackner and Berlin. 
They also said that plea negotiations are continuing with some targets, and stressed that it wasn't clear how many officials or former officials of the defense contractors would be charged. 

   Officials said that by seeking charges against the two prominent contractors and some senior executives, Mr. Hudson hopes to allay criticism that his investigation, which involved many wiretaps and became public amid great fanfare last summer, has failed to live up to expectations. 
Prosecutors also hope to prod other companies and executives into cooperating. 

   Several people said that the Hazeltine inquiry concerns assistance Mr. Parkin gave the company on a still-pending Navy contract for anti-aircraft equipment. 
Mr. Parkin has acknowledged paying Mr. Lackner more than $15,000 in return for secret data on the Navy's plans and requirements. 
He said he concluded that Mr. Lackner got the information from Mr. Berlin, the Navy engineer. 

   Mr. Parkin charged the Teledyne electronics unit for assistance on an Air Force contract. 
He said he divided $18,000 from Teledyne evenly with Mr. Lackner and another associate.

<HL> Heard on the Street: Arbs Are Burned -- and They're Burned Up -- By Emery Takeover Deal That Broke Down </HL>

   For powerless rank-and-file investors, here's a delicious tale: A bunch of professional takeover speculators got trapped in a deal that went nowhere. 

   The speculators in question recently snapped up an estimated 10% of the shares of Emery Air Freight, a struggling company under pressure from lenders. 
Presto. 
A few weeks later Emery apparently got a bid of $8 a share, or about 50% more than the takeover pros known as risk arbitragers had paid. 

   Arbs believe that at a "secret" Saturday board meeting -- which Emery didn't disclose but speculators soon discovered -- Emery's board authorized management to make a deal with the rumored suitor, Consolidated Freightways, whose own directors cleared the plan the next day. 

   But then, whamo! 
The target's management had second thoughts, and killed the deal overnight. 
Speculators were bagged in a sleepy little stock now selling for almost one-fifth less than some of them paid. 

   Here is the story making the rounds, according to one arb, who normally keeps juicy details to himself but this time is pushing for wider disclosure of the talks. 
Perhaps he's hoping that an announcement would spur amateur takeover speculation, allowing him to bail out of the stock or putting added pressure on Emery management and directors to sell the company. 

   Emery's board met at its Wilton, Conn., headquarters on the afternoon of Saturday, Nov. 5 -- bankers' twice -- extended deadline for Emery to restructure its finances. 
On the agenda, the arb says, was a bold alternative that the board approved, authorizing management to work toward an $8-a-share takeover by Consolidated. 

   On Sunday morning, Consolidated directors huddled to ratify the deal at the offices of a law firm in San Francisco, not far from the big trucking company's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters. 
"But in the middle of their meeting, Emery's chairman (William F. Souders) calls to say the deal's off," the arb relates. 
"Just kills the whole thing. 
Then they never even announce they had a deal. 
It's outrageous." 

   He suggests that his outrage is high-minded, stemming from concern over Securities and Exchange Commission rules requiring timely disclosure of material events. 

   Emery did announce on Monday Nov. 7 that it had worked out some details of a debt restructuring, including preliminary commitments on a three-year, $125 million revolving credit accord. 
Down at the end of the news release came a hint of a busted deal. 

   "The restructuring is the result of the board's exploration of alternatives with respect to the future of the company," the statement said, "including other forms of equity or debt investment in the company, as well as the possibility of business combinations with third parties." 

   The arbs apparently waded into Emery stock late September and early October. 
Trading data suggest that as many as 2.5 million shares were accumulated by arbs, mostly at prices between 5 and 5 1/2, with some purchased for 5 3/4. 
The stock finished yesterday at 4 3/4. 

   Yet it's understandable that Emery's management might have reservations about an $8-a-share bid. 
Emery's losses have been narrowing, and the stock traded as high as 18 last year. 

   Both Emery and Consolidated Freightways are publicly ignoring the brouhaha. 
Consolidated Freightways has been publicly silent since declaring a regular dividend Nov. 2. 
Spokesmen for both companies decline to comment on the arb's story, citing policies of not responding to takeover rumors and speculation. 

   But, especially on the Emery side, people are clearly not amused. 
"The detail he has. 
It's . . . it's apalling," sputters a securities lawyer familiar with Emery's situation. 

   As for disclosure problems, "nonsense," the lawyer says. 
"An agreement in principle (on a merger) would have to be announced, but authorizing the management to negotiate with an acquirer is something far short of that. 
Emery knows what they're doing. 
They're very careful about things like that." 

   Barring an actual takeover, some arbs would seem to be in a pickle. 
According to Zack's Investment Research Inc., none of the eight Wall Street analysts who follow Emery stock currently rate it a buy, and four are recommending its sale. 
And trading records indicate that, at most, only a few hundred thousand of the shares that arbs accumulated in September and October could have been sold following last week's Emery restructuring news. 

   This leaves the arbs who still hold Emery stock exposed to some other merciless denizens of the Wall Street deep -- short sellers. 
What a shame.

   McKee Baking Co., based in Collegedale, Tenn., said it has withdrawn peanut butter wafer cookies from store shelves and stopped production of the products because salmonella bacteria was found in some cookies during routine testing. 

   McKee, which is closely held, said the cookies were withdrawn from retail outlets in the East and Southeast. 
The cookies in question were sold under the brand names Little Debbie Nutty Bar and McKee Peanut Crunch. 
The company didn't disclose the value of products that were taken off the market but said its other 27 product lines weren't affected. 

   A company spokeswoman said production of the cookies has been stopped until the source of the bacteria is located. 
The Food and Drug Administration is assisting the company in that effort, she said, adding: "We're really committed to making sure our products are good quality." 

   The company said consumers may receive a full refund by returning any questionable cookies to the company.

   Ames Department Stores Inc., Rocky Hill, Conn., said it definitively agreed to buy the West Hartford, Conn., headquarters building of Coleco Industries Inc., a toy maker, for $13.2 million. 

   Coleco plans to sell the building at that price after buying it for $8 million from the lessor, Talcott Office Park, a partnership, half of which is owned by Arnold and Leonard Greenberg, members of Coleco's founding family. 
The remaining $5.2 million would be divided among Coleco and two of its creditors. 
The deal is expected to be approved in a federal bankruptcy court next month, unless a higher bid emerges, Ames said. 
Coleco is operating under protection from creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code while it tries to reorganize. 

   If the plan is approved, Ames, which last month bought Zayre Corp.'s discount-store division for $775 million, said it will move most of the Zayre employees to the Hartford area from Framingham, Mass., over the next year as part of a consolidation effort; a new Hartford area headquarters is planned for completion by 1991.

   American President Cos. said it will pay $34 a share for 4.4 million of its common shares tendered as part of a buy-back offer. 

   The rail, truck and ocean shipping concern said 4.6 million shares were tendered in response to the offer, which expired Monday. 
The original offer called for American President to pay between $31 and $34 a share, depending on the number of shares tendered, and on prices specified by the tendering shareholders. 
Final terms and payment dates for the offer will be determined after tenders are verified, the Oakland company said. 

   American President, which analysts regard as a takeover candidate, launched the offer in October. 
At that time, it was discussing a standstill agreement with Itel Corp. of Chicago, which had accumulated a 12.5% stake in the company. 
Itel hasn't made further purchases of American President shares since the tender offer.

<TEXT>
   This is the story of a good idea gone sour. 

   Back in mid-1986 a panel supported by the Carnegie Corporation issued a thoughtful report on teachers. 
Seeking to boost teachers' quality and professionalism, panelists urged creation of a permanent national board to examine teacher prowess and to stamp its approval on teachers it finds well-qualified. 
Just as you now can insist on having your baby delivered by a board-certified obstetrician, you would be able to demand that your child be instructed by a board-certified teacher. 
Though teachers wouldn't have to seek this certification, presumably the good ones would want it. 
In time, some bold school systems would refuse to consider candidates lacking board endorsements. 

   The panel stipulated that the board not be a governmental entity, any more than medical specialty boards or bar associations are. 
Nary a word was uttered about federal funds. 

   This idea won many plaudits. 
Teaching today is a heavily unionized occupation without much quality control, sense of professionalism, or rewards for excellence. 
When such rewards have been proposed (merit pay, career ladders and the like), the unions usually have shot them down, arguing that there is no reliable basis by which to distinguish superb teachers from mediocrities. 
The new national board might finally furnish such a mechanism. 

   The big question, of course, was whether it would impose sufficiently lofty standards of performance and insist that these be met by any teacher seeking certification. 
It could easily be too lax, too deferential to college transcripts, seniority or popularity. 
The proof of this pudding would be in the tasting. 

   Two and a half years later, no pudding is in sight. 
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards itself exists, 64 members strong. 
Two-thirds of them are teachers -- and all but one of these are union members, including Mary Futrell, president of the National Education Association; Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers; and other senior NEA and AFT officials. 
The Carnegie Corporation has been generous with start-up funds, and the board now has two offices and a sizable staff. 
But not a single teacher has been certified, nor has the board said when any will be. 

   Instead, it has declared that more research must first be done -- 10 major categories of it, according to a list board chairman Jim Hunt, former Democratic governor of North Carolina, furnished the Senate. 
Years of research. 
Fifty million dollars of research. 
And the lobbying is intense for half that tab to be paid by the federal government. 

   Additional research is always welcome. 
But few topics in education have been studied more extensively over the decades than teaching. 
Good teaching is part art, part science, but it is no great mystery. 
Good teaching leads to children learning. 

   Start with 50 super classroom practitioners -- the latest crop of state "teachers of the year," for example -- and send them out to observe and interview other teachers; check the students' test scores; quiz the principals. 
In short order the board would be doing exactly what it was set up to do: certifying excellent teachers. 
And the schools would have board-certified teachers to hire, promote and reward. 

   But the board is doing no such thing. 
Instead it is pressing Congress to subsidize its elaborate research agenda over the next half decade. 

   In August, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) and five colleagues sponsored a bill that would do just that. 
When it was introduced, co-sponsor Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.) quoted Luther, Cardinal Newman and FDR, as well as Providence high school teacher Susan Kaplan. 
Sen. Dodd said the enterprise to be aided is "revolutionary." 
The bill is the pet not only of the teacher-union chiefs, but also of Republican Govs. 
Tom Kean and Bob Orr, and of such business heavies as Xerox's David Kearns and Du Pont's Richard Heckert. 
While Congress didn't enact the bill in the past session, observers on Capitol Hill expect it to pass next year. 

   Then the interminable research process would commence. 
This probably means no teachers would be certified until the mid-1990s, raising the question of whether the board, dominated by the teacher unions, finds it convenient to delay actual appraisals while giving the appearance of activity. 
What is more, the board wants exclusive control over the federal money. 

   Assuming that a big new federal investment in research into teacher evaluation is defensible -- and it's certainly not an outrageous notion -- under standard protocols all interested scholars and institutions could compete. 
But Sen. Dodd's bill in effect orders the secretary of education to put $25 million into a bucket and hand it to the board. 
Sure, there are certain disclosure and reporting requirements. 
But no public official will have any say about who gets the money or what they do with it. 
And nobody but the board is eligible. 

   That's the definition of a pork barrel project. 
Dozens slide through Congress every year. 
But this one also sets a precedent: federal aid to a professional standards board. 
If the bill passes, we can expect other professions and trades to then demand their due. 

   That the teaching occupation needs high professional standards is indisputable -- and the board created for that purpose should get on with the task. 
For its part, Congress should think twice before erasing yet another line of demarcation between public and private.

   A $41 million settlement has been reached on all claims stemming from the 1987 collapse of the apartment complex L'Ambiance Plaza in which 28 people were killed. 

   State Superior Judge Frank S. Meadow, one of two judges who served on a mediation panel, said the settlement would resolve all claims against some 40 defendants, including the contractor and various subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. 
The settlement is expected to be signed after review by lawyers on all sides.

<TEXT>
   Continental Illinois Corp. hired three experienced traders to run its global foreign-exchange trading business, which the banking concern hopes to build into a major profit center. 

   As profit margins in lending have thinned, most big commercial banks have greatly expanded their trading in currencies and bonds to boost profits. 
S. Waite Rawls III, a Continental vice chairman in charge of trading, said his goal is to produce foreign-exchange profit of $100 million or more a year within three to four years, a level that rival First Chicago Corp. is at currently. 

   To do that, Mr. Rawls hired the three traders and expects during the next two years to increase the foreign-exchange staff to about 100 professionals from 35. 

   Hired to manage foreign exchange in Chicago is Jeffrey M. Mondschein, 36 years old, formerly manager of corporate foreign exchange for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Merrill Lynch Capital Markets unit. 
For its London trading operation, Continental hired Simon J. Morris, 38, a former bank trading officer who most recently worked as a financial adviser to a Saudi Arabian prince. 
Takenori Kato, 38, formerly an assistant general manager at Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Co., was named to head Tokyo foreign exchange for Continental. 

   The three managers weren't given traditional banking titles such as vice president or senior vice president, something Continental is moving away from in favor of titles that describe actual jobs.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed a $93 million product liability suit against the maker of Tylenol and a grocery chain in a case involving capsule tampering that allegedly killed a 23-year-old New York woman. 

   Judge Gerard L. Goettel, sitting in White Plains, N.Y., found for McNeil Consumer Products Co., a unit of New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., which owns the store where the cyanide tainted Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules were reportedly purchased. 
Claims against Johnson &amp; Johnson, originally a co-defendant, were dismissed earlier. 

   In February 1986, a medical examiner found that Diane Elsroth died after ingesting two Tylenol capsules "contaminated by a lethal dose of potassium cyanide." 
Her death was ruled a homicide but hasn't yet been solved. 

   Spokesmen for Johnson &amp; Johnson and Montvale, N.J.-based A&amp;P said the companies were gratified by the decision. 
A&amp;P is 52%-owned by Tenglemann Group of West Germany. 
Attorneys for the estate of Ms. Elsroth couldn't be reached.

<HL> Abreast of the Market: Stocks Post Gains in Slow Session As Investors Await Trade Report </HL>
<AUTHOR> David Wilson </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> STK NDX </IN>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices managed a narrow advance in one of the slowest sessions of the year, as the approach of today's report on the U.S. trade deficit kept many investors out of the market. 

   Buying interest was largely confined to blue-chip issues, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a string of four consecutive declines by rising 12.09 to 2077.17. 

   Just 115,170,000 shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Many investors apparently chose to wait for the September trade report, which is due before today's opening. 
The total was among the 10 lowest this year and the lowest since Sept. 29, when 113.7 million shares were traded. 

   Broader market averages trailed the industrials but also managed to advance. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index finished at 268.34, up 0.62, equivalent to about a five-point rise in the industrials. 
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.51 to 252.41, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.29 to 151.33. 

   Advancing and declining issues were almost even on the Big Board, as 715 stocks rose in price and 709 fell. 

   Traders attributed the strength in blue-chip shares partly to optimism about the trade report, which is generally expected to show a September trade deficit narrower than August's $12.18 billion. 
The consensus forecast among economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was for a deficit of $10.5 billion. 

   Relative stability in the dollar and the bond market's rebound from an early downturn also boosted stocks yesterday, traders said, as did some technically oriented buying triggered by the market's recent weakness. 

   With the market's attention focused squarely on the trade report, news of a larger-than-expected 0.9% increase in October retail sales had little impact even though it provided further evidence that the economy hasn't slowed as much as earlier figures suggested. 

   On the other hand, the potential for the dollar to resume its recent slide if the trade report is disappointing raises the possibility that the Federal Reserve could push interest rates higher, both to boost the dollar and to cool the economy. 

   The recent rise in short-term rates prompted PaineWebber Inc. to increase the cash position in its model portfolio to 46% while cutting the stock and bond weightings to 19% and 35%, respectively. 
Mary Farrell, a market strategist with the firm, said the cash level is its highest since mid-1982. 
The stock portion, she said, has remained around 20% for several months. 

   Considering the relatively high level of short-term rates, Ms. Farrell said, it would be "virtually impossible" for stocks to mount a sustainable rally now. 
The latest upturn in rates "has increased our degree of confidence that the market is particularly vulnerable here," she said. 

   Because of this, she said, any favorable market reaction to the trade report is likely to be short-lived. 
She said PaineWebber expects stocks to decline 10% to 15% from their late-October peaks before they can stage a recovery. 
Currently, the Dow Jones industrials are about 5% below their Oct. 21 high of 2183.50. 

   Rajiv Sharma, a portfolio manager at Serco Investments, Larkspur, Calif., said any trade-induced rally that is confined to blue-chip issues isn't likely to last. 
"That would tend to make me very cautious," he said. 

   To avoid being quickly reversed, Mr. Sharma said, any gain in stocks would have to be broad-based and accompanied by an upturn in bond prices. 
Higher bond prices, he said, would reduce the pressure that interest rates are placing on the market. 

   Several blue-chip issues posted solid gains. 
General Motors rose 3/4 to 81 1/8, Union Carbide advanced 3/8 to 26 1/8, Westinghouse Electric tacked on 3/4 to 50 1/4, Sears Roebuck gained 3/4 to 41 5/8, F.W. Woolworth rose 7/8 to 51 1/4, and Coca-Cola went up 5/8 to 42 1/4. 

   Prime Computer jumped 1 7/8 to 17 3/4 on Big Board composite volume of 2.3 million shares as MAI Basic Four, controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, launched a $20-a-share tender offer for the company. 
MAI dropped 1 to 11 3/8 after trading as high as 13 3/8; some analysts suggested that Mr. LeBow's bid is an effort to force Prime to use the "Pac-Man" takeover defense, in which the target company takes over its unwanted suitor. 

   West Point-Pepperell rose 1 1/8 to 43 1/8 after a federal judge rejected the company's bid to block investor William Farley's $48-a-share takeover offer. 
The judge also barred Pepperell from using major portions of its "poison pill" takeover defense. 

   Veeco Instruments, which resumed discussions on a possible $26.50-a-share offer for the company, gained 1 3/8 to 23 1/8. 
Talks with the suitor, who hasn't been identified, were suspended last week. 

   J.C. Penney climbed 1 to 53. 
Its third-quarter earnings were better than many analysts had expected. 
Although net income fell slightly, its per-share earnings rose to $1.17 from $1.14 a year earlier because of a smaller number of shares outstanding. 

   International Flavors &amp; Fragrances , which raised its quarterly dividend to 48 cents a share from 40 cents, gained 1 7/8 to 46 1/2. 

   Longview Fibre fell 2 1/8 to 66 1/2 after Merrill Lynch reported that pricing in the linerboard industry is beginning to show some weakness. 
The company, which told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that linerboard accounts for "a little more than half" of its business, disputed the Merrill Lynch finding. 

   Fuqua Industries added 3/4 to 29 3/8 on news that Triton Group raised its stake in the company to the equivalent of 9.9% and may consider a takeover. 
Triton recently acquired an option to buy about 1.3 million common shares from the Fuqua family. 

   Gulf States Utilities gained 1/2 to 9 as the market awaited developments in a Louisiana rate case involving $1.4 billion of costs associated with the River Bend nuclear-power plant, which has been completed. 

   The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.19 to 289.59. 
Volume was 8,280,000 shares, compared with 8,580,000 Monday. 
There were 264 issues advancing, 301 declining and 292 unchanged. 

   Tech-Ops Landauer advanced 2 1/4 to 37. 
The company reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and declared a 2-for-1 stock split payable to shares of record Dec. 9. 
In the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company earned 65 cents a share, compared with 57 cents a share a year earlier. 

   Barr Laboratories slipped 5/8 to 6 after reporting a loss of $257,000 for its first quarter, ended Sept. 30. 
It had net of $875,000 a year earlier.

   Dillard Department Stores Inc., Little Rock, Ark., said Joseph Horne Co. and others sued it and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., charging that they breached their contract when they failed to acquire the Pittsburgh department store chain. 

   As previously reported, a joint venture including Dillard and DeBartolo agreed to buy Horne in April, but terminated the agreement in August after a review. 
The purchase price wasn't disclosed. 

   Dillard disclosed that the lawsuits were filed in federal and state courts in Pittsburgh in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
The department store chain said it intends to vigorously defend itself and said it doesn't expect the lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on the company. 

   DeBartolo is based in Youngstown, Ohio.

<HL> Fiat Seeks Approval To Trade Its ADRs On the Big Board </HL>

<TEXT>
   Fiat S.p.A. said it requested a listing on the New York Stock Exchange for its American Depository Receipts, a move analysts said could help boost Fiat's stock and the Italian market as a whole. 

   "There's been a huge interest in Italy but a lot of investors are still scared off by the settlement problems," said Tony Morrongiello, analyst at Carnegie International Securities in London. 
Fiat, an auto maker based in Turin, is Italy's biggest private-sector company. 

   U.S. interest in the Milan Stock Exchange has been growing as Italy's economy, and many big Italian companies, showed good growth this year. 
Some international investment funds have begun increasing their presence in Italy, but many investors have been leery of the Milan exchange, which has had problems keeping trading settlements up to date. 

   By offering ADRs, which are essentially certificates listed in New York that represent shares traded in Milan, Fiat hopes to offer investors a chance to sidestep such problems. 
The ADRs, which will be sponsored by First Boston Corp., won't represent new equity for the auto maker. 

   Fiat said the move is part of a plan to increase the global exposure of its stock and to raise the company's profile in the U.S., where its interests include robotics, auto parts, trucks, farm equipment and Alfa Romeo sports cars. 

   Fiat already is traded in Frankfurt and Paris as well as Milan, and the company plans to seek a London listing. 
It is only the third Italian company, after Montedison .S.p.A. and Benetton S.p.A., to request a New York listing. 

   The company said it expects ADR trading to begin early next year if it gets Securities and Exchange Commission approval. 
Each ADR will represent five shares of Fiat stock. 

   Fiat's stock has languished at about 10,000 lire ($7.69) since hitting a high of 16,600 lire in September 1986. 
A Fiat spokesman declined to say what percentage of the company's shares would be traded in New York, but the Italian news agency ANSA put the figure at about 10%. 

   Fiat has 2.4 billion shares outstanding, and is 40% owned by the family holding company of Chairman Giovanni Agnelli. 
A group of Italian and international banks and investment funds own an additional 13% of the company, while the rest is held by 150,000 small shareholders.

<HL> Court Bars Columbia From Release of Film Under Current Title </HL>

<TEXT>
   A state court commissioner issued an injunction against Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. releasing its film, "The Adventures of Baron Muenchhausen" overseas with its current title. 

   Commissioner Virginia Chernack ruled that Columbia Pictures must change the title or show a disclaimer if it distributes the film overseas. 
The ruling came in a cross-complaint filed by producer Allan Buckhantz, who said that he acquired rights to the story of the legendary 18th century character in 1968 from a German concern that made an earlier "Baron Muenchhausen" during World War II. 

   The disclaimer, if used, would have to stipulate that Columbia's picture is "not to be confused" with the 1942 picture, "The Adventures of Baron Muenchhausen," Commissioner Chernack ruled. 
Mr. Buckhantz said he is currently distributing the 1942 movie in movie theaters in Europe. 

   Mr. Buckhantz accused Columbia of unfair competition and breach of contract in connection with the film. 
Columbia had sued Mr. Buckhantz for malicious prosecution after Mr. Buckhantz sued Columbia for slander. 
Mr. Buckhantz contends that he submitted the story to Columbia, and that Columbia then developed its own movie of the same name. 

   Columbia Pictures attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
   Veeco Instruments Inc.'s talks with a suitor have resumed and still center on a cash price of $26.50 a share, or $280.4 million, the electric-controls company said. 

   Veeco stock, which soared two weeks ago even before the company disclosed the negotiations, plunged last week when the talks were suspended. 
The suitor wasn't identified. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Veeco rose $1.375 a share to close at $23.125, still below its recent 52-week high of $23.50. 

   The company's appeal lies mainly in its dominance as a global supplier of commercial and industrial controls. 
Analysts estimate it accounts for about 20% of the $1 billion market for such controls world-wide. 
Analysts expect the company to report net income of about $12.7 million, or $1.20 a share, for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, on sales of about $260 million. 

   In June, after its stock shot up, the company disclosed what it called "informal and highly preliminary discussions" with parties, which weren't identified, interested in acquiring or participating in the company. 
It couldn't be learned if current negotiations involve any of the same parties in the June talks.

   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $6.2 million, compared with a year-ago net loss of $5.1 million. 

   Sotheby's, which went public in May, said auction houses typically are unprofitable in the summer, an off-season for the business. 
The quarter's aggregate auction sales rose 5.8% to $89.8 million from $84.9 million. 

   London-based Sotheby's, which also is in the finance and real-estate brokerage business, said last week's high prices at auctions in New York propelled fourthquarter sales 29% from year-earlier levels. 

   For the nine months, Sotheby's said net income rose 28% to $30.4 million, or $1.09 a share, from $23.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Auction sales rose 13% to $972.7 million from $857.3 million.

   A federal judge in New York barred Bruce G. Sundlun, chairman of Providence, R.I.-based Outlet Communications Inc., from selling 420,000 Outlet shares to Wesray Capital Corp., a Morristown, N.J.-based leveraged buy-out firm, pending a hearing later this month. 

   The stipulation, signed by U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight in Manhattan, stems from a suit that Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., a New York investment banking firm, filed last week against Mr. Sundlun, alleging breach of contract and seeking $2.8 million in damages. 
Mr. Sundlun can't complete the sale, scheduled for yesterday, at least until next Monday. 
Mr. Sundlun's attorney declined to comment. 

   Mr. Sundlun retained Morgan Stanley last January in connection with an offer by Outlet, an operator of television and radio stations, to buy back shares from Wesray. 
Wesray rejected that offer last June, but an agreement was reached in July for Wesray to buy the Outlet shares for $23.75 each, or about $10 million.

   The U.S. Export-Import Bank appears to be getting into deeper and deeper financial difficulties as overdue loan payments from foreign borrowers increased threefold in the year ended Sept. 30, to more than $2.1 billion. 

   Ex-Im bank officials said about one-fifth of the loans outstanding of the government export-credit agency were in a non-accruing status at the end of fiscal 1988, up from an aggregate figure of about $708.9 million Sept. 30, 1987. 

   The borrowers in the overdue loan category weren't identified. 

   The Ex-Im bank preliminary financial statements for fiscal 1988 also show that the bank incurred a net operating loss of about $455 million, compared with $460.9 million a year earlier. 

   Because of the Ex-Im bank's continuing problems about delinquent loan payments from foreign borrowers, who received credits earlier to help finance their purchases of U.S. goods and services, the U.S. agency's reserves slipped to a negative $142.9 million in fiscal 1988 from $311.8 million a year earlier.

   Rohr Industries Inc., Chula Vista, Calif., said a shareholder suit was filed against the company and its directors alleging various breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with its adoption of a shareholder-rights plan in August 1986. 

   The suit, which purports to be a derivative action on behalf of the company and also seeks class-action status, also cites breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the authorization of a 2-for-1 stock split in 1985, open-market stock repurchases in late 1987 and the company's entry into indemnity agreements with its directors and officers, Rohr said. 

   The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against further implementation of the shareholder-rights plan or further share repurchases. 

   Rohr, an aerospace-parts maker, said it will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, as it "believes the suit is without merit, is ill-founded and that the directors acted in the best interests of the shareholders and have fulfilled all of their fiduciary duties." 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Rohr closed at $25.75, down 87.5 cents.

   News Corp. said net income for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 rose 28% to $133.1 million from $104.2 million because of sharply higher results in Australia and moderately higher results in the United Kingdom.

   Operating profit, before interest, in Australia and the Pacific Basin surged 86%. 
Results in the U.K. rose 21%, while profit in the United States was essentially flat. 
The Fox Broadcasting Co. unit, a U.S. television network, had a loss "substantially lower" than it expected. 

   The latest period's net included a $61.2 million extraordinary gain, largely from the sale of Fox Plaza, a Los Angeles office building. 
After-tax earnings before the extraordinary items, which included a $50.1 million gain a year earlier, rose 33% to $71.9 million from $54 million.

<TEXT>
   Rival bidders have reached a tentative agreement to build two separate pipelines to transport Canadian natural gas to the northeastern U.S., a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission official said. 

   FERC Chief Judge Curtis Wagner said he is "fairly optimistic" that a final agreement can be worked out between groups led by Noverco Inc. of Montreal and Toronto-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. when formal talks resume Tuesday. 

   As previously reported, the two groups proposed rival routes to provide two different groups of customers with gas transported across Canada from Alberta. 
Sources close to the talks say earlier discussions focused on modifying the proposal made by Iroquois Gas Transmission System, in which TransCanada has a 40% stake, to allow some form of participation by the rival Champlain Pipeline Co. of Vermont. 
Iroquois is based in Connecticut. 

   Judge Wagner declined to discuss details of the preliminary pact. 
The Iroquois proposal would cost about $384 million and have a capacity of about 290 billion cubic feet of gas a year. 
The Champlain consortium estimated its pipeline could carry about 216 billion cubic feet of gas a year in its first year and that construction costs would reach about $664 million. 

   One source close to the negotiations said a two-pipeline proposal would ensure the growing demand for natural gas in the northeastern U.S. could be met. 

   The judge said the companies involved in the talks are consulting with prospective buyers and other parties. 
He said he hoped a formal announcement of a final pact could be made when he reports to the commission at the end of the month. 

   TransCanada PipeLines and Champlain declined to comment on the proposal because of the confidential nature of the negotiations. 
Iroquois officials couldn't be reached for comment.

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiffany &amp; Co. reported that earnings and sales jumped to record levels in the third quarter ended Oct. 31. 

   The jewelry maker and retailer's net income rose 43% to $5.3 million, or 51 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales increased 29% to $69.4 million from $54 million. 

   Chairman William R. Chaney attributed the strong results to the addition of three stores in the quarter and the continued diversification of the company's product lines. 

   Sales of stores open a year or more rose 16% in the quarter and 22% in the nine months. 
International retail sales rose 114% in the quarter. 
In the quarter, Tiffany opened stores in Hong Kong, Zurich, and Costa Mesa, Calif. 
It plans to add one new store in the U.S. annually for the next several years, as well as opening other foreign locations. 
Tiffany will open a second Hong Kong store in early 1989. 

   For the nine months, earnings jumped 86% to $12.1 million, or $1.17 a share, from $6.5 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The year-earlier period contained a special charge of $644,000, or seven cents a share, from a one-time write-off of deferred financing costs related to early repayment of debt. 
Sales rose 26% to $187.3 million from $148.2 million. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Tiffany closed yesterday at $42.75 a share, up 50 cents.

   Borland International Inc., Scotts Valley, Calif., said International Business Machines Corp. will give away copies of a new, souped-up version of Borland's popular Sidekick "desk accessory" program, with each copy of IBM's new OS/2 personal computer operating system. 

   The new version of Sidekick, which will be priced at about $250, is the first program available that takes advantage of all of the capabilities of OS/2, a new master control program for high-performance IBM-compatible personal computers that IBM developed with the help of Microsoft Corp. 
So far, OS/2 hasn't sold well, mainly because there were no programs that tap the operating system's snazzy graphics and ability to juggle several computing tasks at once. 

   Sidekick provides a planner calendar, an automated phonebook, a calculator, a bare-bones word processor, and makes it easy for a personal computer to connect with other computers through telephone lines. 
Previous versions of Sidekick have ranked among the personal computer software industry's biggest sellers. 

   A spokeswoman for Borland said the agreement with IBM doesn't specify a cutoff date for the software giveaway.

<TEXT>
   As George Bush assembles his Cabinet team, yesterday adding Nicholas Brady's name to that of James Baker's, our thoughts turn to his desire to make the United States a "kinder and gentler" nation. 
We're all for that, but what is he going to do about Washington? 
It'd be like trying to turn the National Hockey League into a kinder and gentler sport. 

   Yes, we've heard the sweet voice of reason, Jim Wright, saying in recent days that "George Bush said some things during the campaign which give me encouragement to believe that we can find a lot of things on which we can work together." 
Surely, it would be a gain if the executive and legislative branches tried to restore civility and comity to the political life of Washington. 
These hopes, however, must be measured against eight years of high-sticking, spearing and tripping. 

   They must be measured against the Bork hearings, the Meese hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings, unconfirmed judicial appointments, a series of congressionally driven special prosecutions of the executive branch, Mr. Wright's forays into foreign policy, presidential budgets called "dead on arrival," and a culture whose inhabitants speak "only on the condition that they not be identified." 

   Contemporary Washington is an interesting town, but so was the besieged Mexican village Yul Brynner tried to civilize in "The Magnificent Seven" with the help of Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn and Charles Bronson. 
These names came to mind as we considered the prospect of a member of the Bush Cabinet summoned to testify before John Dingell. 
Kinder and gentler indeed. 

   We certainly aren't suggesting that the Bush administration operate from a benchmark of belligerence. 
However, it is important for Mr. Bush's appointees to understand what they are getting themselves into. 

   No one should think that he or she is coming to Washington mainly to cap a long and distinguished career, to enter Washington society or to build a lucrative post-government career. 
The Bush people are being asked to come to Washington to defend a beleaguered presidency. 
Any presumptive appointee who is vague on what the duties, responsibilities and authority of the presidency are nowadays might spend a few minutes reading Article 2 of the Constitution. 

   Cabinet appointees are happy and eager to be part of an American presidency. 
It isn't so clear on Inauguration Day, though, which ones will wilt and which will stand his ground under fire from Congress, the permanent bureaucracies or the media. 

   In this respect, the loudest buzzword in Washington this week is "pragmatist." 
Absent a modern Moliere to define this ideal fellow in a comedy of Washington called "The Pragmatist," it's a little difficult to see his exact shape. 
What is he made of? 
If he is non-ideological, is he a man without ideas? 
What came first, the concept or the compromise? 

   The problem with pragmatism is that it's a theory without a bone. 
It's all bend. 
The Bush transition team is more likely to produce an administration that will endure in Washington if it seeks men and women with sturdy political values. 
This means more than having convictions; most everyone in Washington has convictions or opinions. 
Not everyone in Washington, however, has the courage of his convictions. 

   That value was on display early in the current administration when a White House team of Ronald Reagan, James Baker and Richard Darman, in the face of much ridicule, stood their ground and put through the 1981 supply-side tax cuts (the flaw came in the compromise to stagger their introduction). 
It was on display throughout the current term in Mr. Reagan's determination not to deliver the Contras into the hands of the Sandinistas in the jungles of Nicaragua (the flaw came in believing the House would allow military aid into a compromise). 
It has been on display in Mr. Bush's stated opposition to balancing the budget on the backs of taxpayers, amid much recent, typical smirking from the Beltway. 

   It's no doubt possible to draw up a list of men and women in public life who've developed the toughness to stand up to Washington. 
Ultimately, of course, the choice of who will fill these senior positions falls to George Bush, the fellow whom the "consensus" called a wimp just four months ago. 
It could have been seen back then that any person who remained politically intact after the last eight years in office was no wimp. 
We suspect these people now know exactly what qualities of personal and political character will be needed to succeed and survive in the next four years.

<HL> Christie's Sells 48 Works Of Art for $47.7 Million </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The market for impressionist and modern art was somewhat subdued and selective as 25% of the works offered by Christie's last night didn't sell. 

   Nevertheless, Christie's sold 48 works of art for $47.7 million. 
That was slightly better than the $34 million to $46 million Christie's had estimated beforehand. 

   The big surprise of the evening was that a cubist painting by Picasso, expected to sell for $10 million, didn't sell. 
Bidders stopped at $7 million, which was apparently below the seller's minimum. 
Just the night before at Christie's, a blue period Picasso sold for $24.8 million, a record for the artist. 

   After the sale Christopher Burge, head of Christie's here and the auctioneer, said, " I don't know why it didn't sell. 
I think its quite an austere picture. 
It requires study and thought." 
But Mr. Burge said several bidders expressed interest in the picture after the sale. 

   Still, records were broken for five artists including Jean Arp and Paul Signac. 
The most expensive work was a painting by Claude Monet that sold for $4.7 million. 

   Among the works that didn't sell were drawings by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and paintings by Salvador Dali, Henri Matisse and Fernand Leger. 

   Christie's is a unit of Christie's International PLC based in London.

<TEXT>
   Recognition Equipment Inc. said it expects to post a loss of $13 million to $15 million for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, reflecting an operating loss as well as reorganization of its international operations. 

   The sizable loss, which also will result in a loss for fiscal 1988, is another blow for the troubled maker of document-management systems, which last month was indicted along with two executives for allegedly trying to manipulate the award of Postal Service contracts. 
The company and its executives have pleaded innocent. 

   Recognition said the loss puts it in technical default of its bank credit agreements and said it is negotiating with its banks. 
However, the company said it has more cash on hand than the $18 million it has borrowed for the company and its Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 

   For the fourth quarter last year, Recognition had net income of $5.5 million, or 53 cents a share, after an extraordinary tax benefit of $1.9 million. 
Revenue was $73.9 million. 

   The company said the deficit includes an operating loss of about $3 million, reflecting lower margins and increased legal expenses related to the criminal charges. 
It also includes a $4 million charge to reduce the size of its European work force, a $2 million reserve to cover used equipment in Europe that won't be marketed any longer, and a charge of about $3 million to reduce the value of spare parts it carries for servicing equipment. 
In addition, Recognition said it increased legal reserves by $1 million because of a partial summary judgment issued against it in a civil lawsuit in September. 

   The additional losses, when combined with the legal troubles, portend a bumpy future for the company. 
"They're in danger of losing whatever momentum they had in developing new products, keeping key people and maintaining their credibility with their customer base," said Robert Williams, an analyst with Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner in Dallas. 

   "On the other hand," he said, "an optimist could say the company is doing housecleaning for an eventual restructuring." 
He noted that the company's stock has been trading heavily lately, prompting rumors that someone is accumulating shares. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Recognition's stock closed at $9.25, up 12.5 cents.

<HL> Discrimination Against Some Workers Observed Since Immigration Law Passed </HL>

<CO> LABOR </CO>
<G> CNG JUS </G>
<TEXT>
   More than half a million employers across the U.S. have discriminated against foreign-looking persons since the passage of a 1986 immigration-reform law penalizing employers who hire illegal aliens, according to a congressional report. 

   But the General Accounting Office report said the finding "does not establish that the law has caused a pattern of discrimination. . . . 
It does, however, indicate a need for more education and investigation." 

   The GAO report, the second in a series of three, was triggered by civil-rights groups concerned that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 had encouraged employers to discriminate against foreign-looking U.S. citizens or workers who have valid work permits but aren't U.S. citizens. 
The GAO was also to examine if the law has caused excessive red tape for employers, and if the law is being implemented well. 

   "Of the 3.3 million {employers} who were aware of the law, about 528,000 {16%} had begun or increased the practice of asking only foreign-looking persons for work authorization documents or hiring only U.S. citizens," the report said. 

   About 22% of the employers surveyed weren't aware of the law's existence while a fifth of those who knew of the law, said they didn't understand it, the report said. 

   The survey concentrated on the five states with the most immigrant workers: Texas, California, New York, Florida and Illinois. 
Florida employers had the highest incidence of asking only foreign-looking job applicants for work-authorization papers. 

   Employers from California were the most likely to have a "U.S. citizen only" hiring policy. 
California is home to the nation's largest population of legal alien residents and illegal immigrants, and it also has the largest Hispanic community. 

   By industry breakdown, 13% of employers in the agricultural, garment and food-service sectors said they screen job applicants who look foreign. 
The construction and garment industries had the highest level of employers who hired only U.S. citizens. 

   The GAO report found that the law isn't an unreasonable burden on employers. 
But the report said the Immigration and Naturalization Services should improve and expand its efforts to educate employers on the law. 
The report said the INS approach thus far was "satisfactory." 

   An INS spokesman said the agency "finds the report very positive and we feel very good about it." 
He said that since the GAO concluded its survey early this year, the INS has mailed information to some seven million employers and visited a million others. 

   Others suggested the report was less incriminating than it looked. 
Carl Hampe, a minority counsel on the Senate subcommittee on immigration, said, "The type of discrimination that Congress believes should be deterred is the failure to hire or the improper discharge of an employee because of that person's national origins." 
The GAO hasn't addressed this question directly. 

   The GAO, while cautioning that the report's findings didn't suggest widepread discrimination, added that policy makers should be concerned by the results. 
GAO's final report on this issue is due next November. 
If that report concludes that employer sanctions called for in the 1986 law has resulted in widespread discrimination, Congress can review the law.

<TEXT>
   Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. posted a jump in net income for the fiscal first quarter to $70.2 million, compared with $4 million a year earlier. 
The latest quarter's results included an $82 million pretax gain. 

   The gain reflected Fox's sale in August of its interest in the 34-story Fox Plaza building in Los Angeles. 
Revenue for the quarter, ended Sept. 24, increased 5.3% to $222 million from $210.7 million. 

   The entertainment company, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., attributed the improved earnings to the strong performance of its motion-picture division, which benefited from the films "Big," "Die Hard," and "Young Guns," plus, in foreign markets, "Wall Street" and "Broadcast News". 

   CBS/Fox Video, the company's home-video partnership, also had gains in the quarter. 
The television division's results, however, fell because of lower catalog profit.

   It's time to recognize that the case against Ollie North and the others in the Iran-Contra affair has been political from the start, and that Lawrence Walsh and his boosters in Congress have now lost. 
President Reagan should make it official by issuing some pardons and sending Mr. Walsh packing. 

   Despite two years of pounding headlines about the Iran-Contra "scandal," this issue fell off the radar screens in the election campaign. 
Michael Dukakis tried to generate some interest by agitating for harsh criminal penalties even before any trial had begun, but in the end the administration that Lt. Col. North worked for won the election. 
Among the big reasons the voters decided to keep Mr. Dukakis in Massachusetts was his weak positions on foreign policy. 
In this respect, the voters and Ollie North agree: The world is a dangerous place. 

   Congress huffed and puffed, but didn't pass a single piece of legislation it had threatened in the wake of Iran-Contra. 
A plan to make the national security adviser subject to Senate approval went nowhere. 
A proposal that Presidents must tell Congress about all covert operations within 48 hours died after Speaker Jim Wright did some leaking of his own, posing a threat to jailed dissidents in Nicaragua. 

   Meanwhile, Mr. Walsh and his phalanx of lawyers, FBI agents, IRS inspectors and others by the end of September had spent some $10.8 million of taxpayer money to bring a criminal case a county prosecutor would be too embarrassed even to consider. 
As Gordon Crovitz shows nearby, the core of Mr. Walsh's case so misstates the executive-branch view of the law that the Justice Department on Friday will file a brief against him. 
How strange this filing will be. 
Mr. Walsh is the U.S. in U.S. v. 
North, yet to make his case he felt he had to take positions that the U.S. government never takes. 
Among these is the incredible claim that people can go to jail for violating a law that Congress might have passed, but didn't. 

   Mr. Walsh may be playing to the Congressmen who created independent counsel to sic on executive-branch officials, but there is no reason for the executive to put up with this nonsense. 
In its request to Judge Gerhard Gesell seeking permission to file against Mr. Walsh, the Justice Department said such a brief would be the "most practical way for the court to ascertain the legal positions that have been adopted by the executive branch." 
This is not the only step President Reagan can take. 

   In upholding independent counsel in Morrison v. 
Olson, the Supreme Court emphasized that "the attorney general may remove an independent counsel for 'misconduct.'" 
It's hard to imagine any greater abuse by a prosecutor than taking positions so at odds with the Constitution, common law and established Justice policies merely to crucify his targets. 
President Reagan should exercise his legitimate authority and fire Mr. Walsh rather than permit the prosecutor to wander even further from his original charge. 
Mr. Walsh's latest arguments show that there is no legal case against the Iran-Contra defendants. 

   There is yet another reason for presidential pardons. 
It is that separation of powers has become one of the chief political issues of the day. 
Congress has been usurping traditional executive-branch functions, from independent counsel to veto-proof omnibus appropriations to the War Powers Resolution to who interprets treaties. 
This institutional battle is now also partisan, with Democrats eager to pummel an office they see no hope of capturing while at the same time expanding the powers of the branch they control. 

   Democrats in Congress have already thrown down the gauntlet to George Bush. 
He has no mandate, they say, and he'll have to take his marching orders from them. 
President Reagan can put his successor on firmer ground with pardons that will tell Congress that the executive branch won't sanction any more criminalizing of policy differences. 

   President Reagan has an obligation to future Presidents to leave the office with its constitutional powers and position intact. Sometimes this means running the risk of political heat, though in the case of Iran-Contra pardons this risk is small. The dangers of failing to do the right thing may be greater. On this, President Reagan might want to consult the biblical scholar, Hillel:
   "If I am not for myself, who will be? 
And if I am for myself only, what am I? 
And if not now, when?"

<HL> Air Fares Soaring for Leisure Travelers --- Latest Move By Continental Lifts MaxSavers </HL>
<AUTHOR> Asra Q. Nomani and Jonathan Dahl (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> TEX </CO>
<IN> AIR </IN>
<TEXT>
   This has been a tough year for bargain-hunting vacation travelers, and it's about to get a lot worse. 

   Over the past week, airlines have gotten attention for moving to eliminate a discount fare primarily used by business travelers. 
But yesterday they returned to the strategy they've pursued since summer: going after the leisure traveler. 

   In a move led by Continental Airlines, the lowest-priced round-trip fares -- the MaxSavers -- may soon jump by as much as $90. 
Yesterday, the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary announced the new fares as part of a broad restructuring of its rates aimed at tying fares closer to mileage flown. 

   Continental wouldn't disclose the size of the average increase, and noted that it is actually cutting fares on some routes. 
Other carriers, however, say the overall result will be a fare increase for vacation travelers. 

   Effective next Wednesday, most discount fares apparently will go up between $10 and $20 each way, but some fares may go up a lot more if Continental's new fare structure is widely imitated. 
For instance, the lowest price Continental currently offers from Chicago to Los Angeles is $208 round trip. 
Under the new fare structure, Continental plans to raise that price by $90 to $298 during off-peak times, and to $338 during peak periods, according to travel agents who saw the new fares in their computer systems late yesterday afternoon. 

   A round-trip fare between Chicago and Orlando, Fla., will rise to $258 from $198. 
Under the new fare structure, Continental divides its discount fares into nine mileage categories, each of which have both a peak price and an off-peak price. 
For instance, on flights that go between 1,001 and 1,250 miles, Continental plans to charge $298 during the peak period, and $258 on off-peak hours, travel agents say. 
Continental defines off-peak flights as those between Monday noon through Thursday noon. 
In most markets, the new fares require a 14-day advance purchase, and they all require a Saturday stay. 
In some cases, the new system means fares will go down; on flights between Phoenix and Tampa, the round-trip fare will decline $30 to $318. 

   Although mileage-based plans like Continental's rarely achieve full acceptance in the industry, it's likely that a large chunk of the plan will stick and be copied by other carriers. 
If so, it will be the third time since September that carriers have boosted their lowest fares. 
In October, United Airlines led the industry in raising one-way MaxSaver fares by $20 -- one of the largest percentage increases ever in discount fares. 
That followed an industrywide $10 increase in September. 

   The net effect of all three fare increases: Bargain fares aren't looking like such a bargain anymore. 
After the latest increase, the round-trip fare for a nonstop flight from New York to Los Angeles will rise to $358 from $338 for weekday travel. 
Just last year, transcontinental fares were as low as $178 round trip. 

   The big increases for vacation travelers represent a significant shift in airline pricing. 
Until this year, the industry's big increases always seemed to be aimed primarily at business travelers. 
Now, airlines are suddenly going after the more price-sensitive leisure traveler. 

   "It would be fair to say that vacation fares have been going up more recently than business fares," says a pricing executive at Delta Air Lines. 
He says that until the latest pricing moves, discount fares generally represented a 70% to 75% discount off the full-coach fare. 
Now, he says, the discount is closer to 60% to 65%. 

   One reason: Demand recently has been rising faster than the industry expected. 
Following a fairly flat summer, air traffic suddenly is up. 
In September, airline traffic jumped 4%. 
In October, even after the fare increases, traffic rose 5%. 
One airline executive calls those results "surprising." 
As a result, airlines want to see if they can put through yet another increase without causing traffic to decline. 

   Airlines also have been finding it tougher to squeeze more out of the business traveler. 
Recently, businesses have become increasingly sophisticated in finding bargains -- and using the clout of big corporate travel budgets to negotiate their own special deals with carriers. 

   Airlines this year have tried repeatedly to get more revenue from business travelers -- by raising the fares they use or adding restrictions to their deepest discounts. 
And now the industry plans to do that again by eliminating some business discount fares next week. 

   But lately, many companies have been learning how to stay one step ahead of these moves. 
In recent years, many large companies have set up their own in-house travel agencies or hired large outside agencies to track discount fares better. 
Airlines change more than 200,000 fares a day, and the companies' agencies use high-speed computers to sift through these changes and pull out the best deals. 

   With this new technology, companies probably will still be able to find deals even if the airlines go ahead and eliminate some business-fare discounts next Wednesday. 
And it's far from certain that the latest increases on business fares will stick -- already, the airlines have postponed the move for seven days, and some smaller carriers such as Midway Airlines say they won't match the increases. 

   Regarding vacation travelers, one major change has been a leveling of travel demand throughout the year. 
Now more people are taking vacations in traditional off-peak periods, and the increased demand has made discounting less necessary for carriers. 
In years past, for instance, it was common for airlines to announce special fares for the days after Thanksgiving and New Years. 
To a limited extent that may happen this year; yesterday, for instance, Northwest Airlines announced a $20 discount on fares for five days in December. 
But the fare carries many restrictions, and pricing executives at big carriers say they don't anticipate discounts will be as deep or as widespread as in previous years. 

   "People are traveling more often and they are traveling year round," says John Tague, an executive at Midway Airlines. 
For example, he says that Midway used to offer lower fares to Florida in off-peak periods, but now "Florida is a year-round market. 
We get a steady flow of traffic there all year round." 

   Airlines think this is happening because more people today have more leisure time and more flexible work schedules, and also because more travelers want to avoid big crowds when they take vacations. 

   "The old two or three week vacations have gone out of style," says James Pazienza, president of Uniglobe Full Service Travel Inc., a Washington, D.C., agency. 
He says more people like to get away for short periods -- but do it more often each year. 
He says one of his clients soon will depart on his fourth "minivacation" this year. 
"He just wanted to go skiing for a long weekend. 
Cost wasn't a problem. 
Where wasn't a problem. 
He doesn't even know how to ski." 

   With such strong traffic, airlines didn't have to drop prices in the fall the way they have in other years. 
In fact, most carriers actually increased fares, according to the Air Transport Association. (More people still flew in the summer than in the fall, but the month-to-month comparisons show a leveling off in seasonal travel patterns.) 

   Some analysts figure airlines are testing how far they can go with fares. 
"I put this in the category of experimentation," says James Cammisa Jr., an airline and travel industry consultant. 

   He believes there's some risk to the airlines. 
Short impulsive vacation trips may go by the wayside because of the latest moves. 
It's not as easy to say, "let's get away this weekend," Mr. Cammisa says. 

   Now, "it's clearly harder for the vacationer to find good deals," says Mack Koonce, an executive vice president at CUC International Inc., a big travel agency in Stamford, Conn., that specializes in leisure travel.

   Mercury Bay Boating Club Inc., New Zealand's challenger for the America's Cup, asked a state trial court to disqualify the September race won by the San Diego Yacht Club, the defender. 

   Mercury Bay filed its motion in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
Mercury Bay asks that it be named the winner and for the San Diego club to turn the cup over to it because San Diego used a catamaran. 
San Diego responded with a countermotion saying cup rules didn't ban catamarans. 

   When Mercury Bay officially issued its challenge for the cup in July, the San Diego club first ignored it, then said it wasn't fair. 
At that point New Zealand's boat hadn't even been built and its entry was going to be twice the size of a standard cup entry. 
Mercury Bay's monohull boat was 90 feet long at the waterline. 
The San Diego club's twinhull catamaran was 60 feet long. 

   Michael Fay, the 38-year-old merchant banker backing Mercury Bay, argues the original rules didn't envision multihull boats. 
San Diego argues the deed doesn't rule them out either. 

   The next America's Cup challenge can't be scheduled because it can't take place until two years after the end of litigation.

<TEXT>
   On Sept. 27 a small group of Buddhist monks shouting Tibetan-independence slogans marched around Lhasa's Jokhang Temple. 
This protest marked the anniversary of the first in a series of anti-Chinese demonstrations held in the Tibetan capital this past year. 
A larger demonstration was expected on Oct. 1, Chinese National Day, but the night before nine truckloads of armed Chinese soldiers were driven around Lhasa's central road in a show of force that effectively squelched any opposition. 

   Although National Day passed without an outbreak of violence, recent visitors report that resentment of Chinese rule has not abated. 
Hundreds of suspected demonstrators have been rounded up in night arrests, plain-clothes police guard monasteries, and armed troops parade on the streets of Lhasa, while foreign journalists, politicians and human-rights observers are denied permission to enter the region. 
At the same time, however, China is taking a more conciliatory tack with Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, whom it is trying to persuade to dismantle his government-in-exile in Dharmsala, India, and return to China. 
In April it dropped its insistence that he stay in Beijing, announcing he would be free to live anywhere in China. 

   In a June speech before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the Dalai Lama gave the first indication his government-in-exile might settle for something less than complete independence. 
He proposed Tibet become a self-governing political entity ruled "in association with the People's Republic of China." 
Under this plan, China would control Tibet's foreign policy and retain a limited number of military bases in the region; internal affairs would be allocated to a democratically elected Tibetan government. 
Although Beijing officially rejected the Strasbourg proposal as a "disguised form of independence," it has offered to meet the Dalai Lama virtually anywhere to discuss any issue except Tibetan independence. 
The Dalai Lama has suggested a meeting in Geneva in January, which the Chinese are now considering. 

   China's new willingness to talk with the man it generally claims is "splitting the motherland and sabotaging the national unity" stems from its sensitivity to international pressure, the single weapon Tibetans have. 
At least six anti-Chinese demonstrations have occurred in Lhasa since the well-publicized uprising in October 1987 splashed Tibet on front pages around the world, and reports of incidents in Eastern Tibet this spring make it appear that Tibetan frustration is spreading. 
A compromise offers the possibility of silencing the Dalai Lama, one of China's most influential critics, by absorbing him into the mainstream. 

   Tibetans are for their part driven by the knowledge that time is running out. 
A generation has grown up in exile or under Chinese rule since the 1959 popular uprising in Lhasa that sent the Dalai Lama and 100,000 followers fleeing to India. 
Quietly but steadily, Tibetan identity is being eroded by a Chinese civilian invasion. 
Since 1983 the government has lured Chinese settlers from interior provinces with offers of higher wages, bonuses and benefits. 
The extent of the resettlement drive is complicated by the definition of "Tibet": More than half of the original territory has been quietly partitioned off into neighboring provinces since the Chinese takeover. 
Although China's right to rule Tibet is questionable on historical grounds, it is internationally accepted as a "fait accompli." 

   Given Tibet's lack of bargaining power, many observers -- particularly non-Tibetans -- suggest it had best settle for whatever compromise can be reached. 
But the Strasbourg proposal met with fierce objections from Tibetan exiles. 
According to the Press Trust of India, the Dalai Lama said in New Delhi Tuesday that the demand for independence had not been dropped. 
"Our struggle for independence shall continue come what may," he said. 
"The Tibetan people need have no fear nor lose heart that their interests will be sold out behind their back by the negotiating team." 

   Many Tibetans worry that if they return with less than independence, the Chinese can simply close the country and nobody will know what is happening. 
Tibetans have every right to their suspicions of compromise with China. 
Thousands of Tibetans were arrested following the March demonstrations; in a follow-up report issued in July, Asia Watch listed the names of 256 detainees still held. 
March 5 was Lhasa's bloodiest day since the uprising of 1959: Between eight and 16 monks were killed, along with two Tibetan laymen and a Chinese policeman. 
Confusion over the number of casualties remains because the official government report admits only five -- and for weeks insisted the only death was the policeman's. 

   Foreigners visiting Lhasa are frequently asked, "Tell America to please help Tibet," reflecting a widespread Tibetan hope that the U.S. will intervene. 
The concept has no place in the world of "Realpolitik" where the U.S. does not question China's right to rule Tibet. 
But in Lhasa, where Tibetan crowds armed with stones and slingshots are pitted against Chinese troops with rifles and tear gas, reality is blurred by hopes. 

   Religion, still the focal point of Tibetan life, remains the focus of aspirations for independence. 
The desire for nationalism is embodied in the person of the 54-year-old Dalai Lama. 
Although requesting a "Dalai Lama photo" has become a game for children in tourist areas, in remoter parts adults' eyes fill with tears at a picture of their exiled leader. 
The precise conditions under which he should return is a question few have considered: Until recently most Tibetans considered his return synonymous with the departure of the Chinese. 

   The current repression in Lhasa emphasizes how cautiously the Dalai Lama must deal with China; at the same time it underlines the necessity of doing so. 
Speaking in England in April, the Dalai Lama admitted the obvious: "China as a government will never give up Tibet." 
The region's strategic position as a Himalayan buffer zone, its tremendous natural resources, and the nuclear-missile bases it shelters make Tibet too valuable to relinquish. 
In quantitative terms alone, Tibetan territory constitutes a quarter of the land mass of China. 
And here is the matter of precedent: Were China to withdraw from Tibet, or even to make concessions, the unruly Moslem minority in neighboring Xinjiang province would agitate for its own independence. 
Tibet is the most troublesome example of China's need to control its 55 minorities -- who together constitute 6% of the nation's population but live on 60% of its land. 

   The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile must weave skillfully among the Chinese world, their own and that of the nearly six million Tibetans in China. 
Having survived 30 years of shifting Chinese policies, from the destruction of the Cultural Revolution to the tourism-inspired liberalizations of the early 1980s and back to the current repressive crackdown, Tibetans have little trust. 
"Once you are bitten by a snake, you feel fear even when you see a piece of rope," the Dalai Lama once commented on dealing with China. 
He himself may need the power of a snake charmer to gain something for Tibet at the negotiating table.

   A federal judge modified a temporary restraining order to block a Cayman Islands company from luring employees away from Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. 

   The company, Energy Information Investments Ltd., was founded by William Liscom, the Weekly's former business manager. 

   Judge John M. Walker's original order banned Energy Information from publishing an oil-industry newsletter to compete with the globally circulated Weekly. 
The order stands until judgment is made within the next four months on the suit filed in June by the Weekly, which is owned by Wanda Jablonski, a longtime associate of numerous Saudi Arabian officials. 

   Energy Information couldn't be reached for comment. 

   The judge's order was in response to the suit filed against Mr. Liscom; Barry Jolly, of the Cayman Islands; and Energy Information. 
The suit alleges the company hired the Weekly's employees after Mr. Liscom wrongfully induced them to leave.

<HL> MAI Basic Faces Doubts in Prime Computer Bid --- Wall Street Reacts Coolly As Target's Shares Close Well Below $20 of Offer </HL>

   Wall Street reacted skeptically to MAI Basic Four Inc.'s $20-a-share tender offer for Prime Computer Inc., a Natick, Mass., concern three times its size. 

   MAI Basic Four is a Tustin, Calif., computer maker controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, who has built a reputation as an investor who buys troubled companies. 

   Some takeover speculators questioned both Mr. LeBow's intentions and his financing. 
Some Wall Street traders said they thought -- although Mr. LeBow denied it -- that he might be trying to get Prime to buy MAI, in a so-called Pac Man defense. 
Two months ago, Mr. LeBow suggested that American Brands Inc. buy his Liggett Group Inc. after he made hostile overtures toward American Brands. 

   Prime Computer closed yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at a sizable discount to the $20 bid price at $17.75 a share, up $1.875. 
MAI Basic Four shares closed at $11.375, down $1 in Big Board trading. 

   Analysts said MAI's computers have little overlap with Prime's machines and questioned whether the two companies would fit together well. 
MAI's bid for Prime "makes no strategic sense," said Harvey L. Poppel, a partner at Broadview Associates, an investment banker in Fort Lee, N.J., that specializes in high technology mergers. 
"I think it's purely a financial grab by MAI's management." 

   One arbitrager said he didn't buy Prime stock because his "gut reaction was: does he want Prime to buy him?" 
The trader was also reluctant to buy stock based on a hostile bid to be financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. when criminal charges are expected to be brought against employees of Drexel. 

   MAI Basic is less than one-third Prime's size measured by sales and even smaller measured by stock-market value. 
With 15 million shares trading at $11.375 each, MAI's market value is about $170 million, or less than one-fifth of the $970 million it is bidding for Prime. 

   Robert Johnson, a technology analyst at Rotan Mosle Inc., of Houston, said he was troubled by the $900 million in debt that MAI Basic Four would obtain to conclude the deal. 
"If the U.S. gets into a recession, the combined companies might not be able to make their debt service," he said. 

   In an interview, Mr. LeBow said he is bidding for Prime because "we feel there are significant synergies between Basic Four and the minicomputer side of Prime," plus potential overhead savings. 
He said he is not interested in getting Prime to buy MAI. 
"We're seriously going to pursue this 100%," he said. 
"This is a fully financed tender offer, not just a HartScott filing," seeking federal permission to accumulate a stake. 

   The Prime bid is something of a departure for Mr. LeBow, a turnaround specialist who got control of MAI in 1985 and stemmed losses it had been posting under another New York investor, Asher Edelman. 
He also acquired a controlling stake in Western Union Corp. at the end of 1987 after a financial restructuring that averted a bankruptcy filing. 

   In mid-September, Mr. LeBow sought federal clearance to buy a stake in American Brands, raising the prospect of American Brands buying Liggett in a letter to its chairman, William J. Alley. 

   But Mr. Alley vowed not to use a Pac Man defense, and Mr. LeBow says he shifted his sights when tobacco stocks ran up in price following proposed megadeals involving RJR Nabisco Inc. and Philip Morris Cos. 

   Some analysts said Mr. LeBow might be trying to prompt Prime to seek a friendlier bid from a larger acquirer. 
Mr. LeBow said he wouldn't make much of a profit in that event because he only owns about two million Prime shares, or a 4.1% stake. 

   Analysts give Mr. LeBow high marks for being able to cut costs. 
According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. LeBow "eliminated 26 vice presidents" at MAI Basic Four "in a matter of weeks" after he took control. 

   In Natick, Mass., a spokesman for Prime Computer said the company's board will consider MAI's offer but declined to comment further on it. 

   Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed Prime's $485 million of subordinated debt, rated double-B-plus, on CreditWatch with negative implications. 
S&amp;P said that the "financial risk of the combined entities would be elevated substantially." 
The rating concern also said Prime's debt as a percentage of total capital, now 56%, "is relatively high" for the current rating.

   The Luxembourg government is drawing up legislation to make the laundering of profits from drug trafficking a criminal offense, a Luxembourg government source said. 

   The action follows the indictment in October of Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International Holdings S.A. by U.S. prosecutors in a money-laundering investigation. 

   The government source, who requested anonymity, said the measure would allow for the confiscation of funds in addition to fines and imprisonment. 
Local press reports said fines of up to 50 million Luxembourg francs ($1.4 million) and prison terms of up to five years could be imposed. 
The proposed law is expected to gain parliamentary approval and go into effect next year.

<HL> Eroding R&amp;D: Slow Rise in Outlays For Research Imperils U.S. Competitive Edge --- In the Frenzy of Buy-Outs, Many Firms Cut Spending Or Farm the Work Out --- The Sarnoff Center Upheaval </HL>

   The David Sarnoff Research Center once produced television breakthroughs for RCA ranging from the first successful electron gun used in a receiver to the color system now used throughout the U.S. 

   In the past year, however, the center has been making news by announcing cutbacks rather than breakthroughs. 
It has discharged about 300 people, slashing its employment by 25%. 

   Few research facilities are trimming sail as severely as Sarnoff, which made the cuts as it was being turned over to SRI International, a nonprofit organization. 
Overall corporate spending for research and development, in fact, continues to edge up. 
But the rate of increase has slowed markedly, imperiling U.S. industry's drive to improve its competitive stance in world markets. 

   John A. Young, president of Hewlett-Packard Co., warns that U.S. industry has "got to expand research and development efforts if it wants to play in this league." 
In the U.S., he notes, nondefense research and development outlays, as a share of overall economic activity, are running "significantly behind West Germany and Japan, and the gap is steadily growing." 

   A recent Congressional Budget Office study tracks this troubling pattern. 
Since 1984, the budget office estimates, inflation-adjusted research and development outlays in private U.S. businesses have risen at an average annual rate of 3%, roughly half the rate of gain in the preceding decade. 
"Despite the greater competition from foreign firms," the study states, "the portion of gross national product devoted to research and development is lower now than it was 20 years ago." 

   The slowdown partly reflects the recent frenzied pace of corporate change in the U.S. through acquisitions and restructurings, claims Dennis Maxwell, a vice president of SRI International, a nonprofit research institute based in Menlo Park, Calif. 
One result, he says, is that "less R&amp;D work is being done by companies in-house, and what's being done is often contracted out." 

   SRI performs such work for an increasing number of corporations, he adds, including the former owner of the Sarnoff center, General Electric Co. GE took over the 350-acre facility when it acquired RCA Corp. in 1986. 
Soon afterward, GE donated the center to SRI, and the layoffs followed. 
GE's overall outlays for research and development fell some $300 million last year, to $3 billion. 

   Kenneth Flamm, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit research group in Washington, expresses particular concern over the effect of corporate restructurings on basic research. 
Because they emphasize near-term results, the restructurings have "clearly contributed to a slowdown in basic research," he contends. 
Basic research, which seeks new concepts, is considered crucial to a corporation's long-run prospects. 
Applied research, which seeks commercial uses for established concepts, tends to benefit a corporation's bottom line much sooner. 

   Mr. Flamm says only about 3% of research and development outlays now go to basic research, down from 5.4% in 1979. 
He cites the pattern at Bell Laboratories, which lately has accounted for some 11% of all basic research in the U.S., down from 17% in 1979, just a few years before the court-ordered reorganization of Bell's parent, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
Since then, the economist says, "the emphasis at Bell Labs increasingly is on applying old ideas, not finding new ones." 

   Bell Labs, however, disagrees with Mr. Flamm's assessment. 
While Bell Labs is putting more emphasis on developing commercial products from its technology, it is still spending 10% of its budget on basic research. 
The budget itself has gone from $2 billion in 1983, just before the Bell break-up, to $2.6 billion this year, a Bell Labs spokesman says. 

   Most of the recent rash of restructuring deals have sharply increased debt-servicing costs of the corporations involved, analysts say, and this has led to a curtailing of outlays in areas such as research and development. 
Because "R&amp;D has higher risks and longer-term payoffs than most expenditures, it's a highly postponable spending item -- a handy target for cost-cutters," says Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington. 

   Evidence of this squeeze can be seen in a prospectus involving Duracell Inc., recently acquired by Duracell Holdings Corp. in a leveraged buy-out organized by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
A large battery producer, Duracell is in a field where technological advances are particularly important. 
Accordingly, the company over the years has depended more heavily than many firms on research efforts. 

   But the prospectus issued in the buy-out observes that the heavy debt-servicing obligations incurred in the acquisition could hurt the company's "ability to respond adequately to technological developments." 

   Last year, according to the prospectus, Duracell's research and development outlays totaled $15.4 million, nearly $5 million higher than in 1986. 
A company spokesman declines to say how much the battery maker plans to spend on R&amp;D this year or next. 
Such reticence seems to be the order of the day. 
Officials at some two dozen debt-laden corporations all declined to specify whether the corporate debt was beginning to squeeze research and development expenditures. 

   Relatively new companies whose growth has lagged behind expectations are scaling down research and development. 
Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst at PrudentialBache Securities Inc., says Genentech Inc. still "probably has the best biotech R&amp;D capability in the world." 
But because of disappointing results of late, Genentech's plans "over the next couple of years call for a reduction in R&amp;D expenditures to 20% to 25% of revenues, down from about 40% now," he says. 

   According to a Genentech spokeswoman, despite the relative declines as a percentage of revenues, research expenditures "have grown and will continue to increase in absolute terms." 
She says research spending was $96.5 million in 1987 and will be about $120 million this year. 
"And in 1989, spending is certain to exceed 1988," although actual amounts haven't yet been budgeted. 

   Among the U.S. industries facing stiff competition from abroad, the electronics companies are particularly likely to suffer from insufficient research and development spending. 
Pat Hill Hubbard, an official of the American Electronics Association, a trade group, recently told a congressional committee that the Japanese government and private industry, working together, have spent at least $300 million, and possibly up to $700 million, on home-video R&amp;D -- and therefore are "poised to enter today's home-video market with several fine products." 
The comparable U.S. R&amp;D investment -- supplied, he added, by "some 10 private research firms" -- totals only about $70 million. 

   The U.S. government spends heavily on research and development, but economists estimate that 80% of this outlay is for military purposes. 
This military effort, moreover, engages close to one-third of the nation's engineers and scientists. 
In countries such as Japan, where military spending plays a much smaller economic role, far more of the research effort benefits private industry. 

   Signs of the lagging of research and development efforts at U.S. businesses abound. 
"Last year, foreign inventors captured almost half of U.S. patents," says Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Young, who also heads the Council on Competitiveness, a Washington group comprising executives, union leaders and academicians whose aim is to foster a more competitive America. 
In 1975, by comparison, foreigners captured only one-third of the country's patents. 
In 1987, for the first time, no U.S. company was among the top three recipients of U.S. patents. 
All were Japanese: Canon Inc., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. 

   At the same time, according to a council report, foreign students account for about 40% of enrollments in U.S. graduate schools of engineering, and they now receive more than half of U.S. doctorates in engineering. 
"U.S. industrial R&amp;D could not live today without foreign-born scientists and engineers," says Roland W. Schmitt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 

   A similar situation prevails at the faculty level. 
"About one-third of the faculties of our engineering schools are foreign-born," Mr. Schmitt says, and "among younger faculty, assistant professors of engineering under 35 years old, the fraction is now one-half." 
Moreover, he adds, "there are as many as 1,800 vacancies today in U.S. university engineering faculties, and that's before a heavy wave of faculty retirements that will hit our universities in the mid-1990s." 

   There is no shortage of ideas for spurring a greater research and development effort in private U.S. businesses. 
B.R. Inman, chairman of Westmark Systems, a privately owned electronics-industry holding company and a member of the Council on Competitiveness, urges such governmental moves as a higher status in the White House for the national science adviser and a less fragmented approach to R&amp;D financing in Congress. 

   The Defense Science Board, an independent advisory group drawn from private industry and academia, recently urged the Defense Department to do more to prevent "an increasing loss of technological leadership to both our allies and adversaries." 

   On the tax front, the R&amp;D investment tax credit was scheduled to expire this year but was recently extended for a year. 
Still, economists say, uncertainty surrounding the measure's future may be deterring research and development efforts, and they urge that the credit be made permanent. 

   A few companies have stepped up their research and development outlays. 
Monsanto Co. devotes 6% to 8% of its revenues to R&amp;D nowadays, up from 3% before the introduction of the R&amp;D tax credit in 1981, reports Nicholas Filippello, chief economist. 
"We're beginning to see the payoff in new products," he says, citing a new item in the biotechnological area -- Bovine Somatatropin -- designed to stimulate cows' milk output.

   Honda Motor Co. said its consolidated, or group, pretax profit slipped 2% in its fiscal second quarter as a result of higher production costs and the strong yen. 

   The Japanese car maker said pretax profit fell to 34.41 billion yen ($278.8 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 35.047 billion yen a year earlier. 

   Net income rose 0.5% to 22.51 billion yen from 22.39 billion yen in the 1987 period. 
Sales rose 7.6% to 811.5 billion yen from 754.5 billion yen last year. 

   For the six months, Honda earned 48.54 billion yen in pretax profits, compared with 50.83 billion yen in the seven months ended Sept. 30, 1987. 

   Net income for the sixth months totalled 76.365 billion yen, compared with 87.876 billion yen in the seven months last year. 
First-half sales totaled 1.674 trillion yen, compared with 1.778 trillion yen. 
Last year's results for the half include an extra month because of a change in Honda's fiscal year. 

   As an indication of the effect of the strong yen, officials said pretax income declined despite price increases overseas and aggressive cost-cutting. 
However, they noted that revenue gained because of favorable car sales in Japan, the U.S. and other overseas markets.

   A DRAFTING ERROR creates an ironic tax-act bonus for mutual-fund holders. 

   Publicly offered funds have been fighting a 1986 law that makes certain fund costs deductible only by holders personally, as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to a 2% floor. 
As widely reported, the 1988 House tax bill would have revoked the rule; however, Congress's final bill only delayed its effect until 1990. 
But wait: The act signed Friday by President Reagan doesn't follow Congress's will. 
Instead, a drafting error eliminates the provision permanently. 

   The relevant 1988-act section provides a reprieve from the 1986 law through 1989 and covers certain related items. 
The error involves a sentence that was meant to terminate that reprieve after 1989: The wording and placement inadvertently revoke forever the requirement to treat the costs as personal miscellaneous deductions. 
The mistake becomes the first known candidate in the 1988 act for a technical correction. 

   Of course, by the time the next tax bill rolls around, Congress may have decided that it prefers to repeal the provision anyway. 

   WORKERS MISCLASSED as independent contractors are sought by the IRS. 

   The IRS has long tracked workers treated improperly as contractors instead of employees subject to withholding taxes. 
Now, with the General Accounting Office, it is checking to see if such people can be spotted by using employers' Form 1099 reports of pay to nonemployees. 
By matching such 1099s with recipients' business income on Schedule C of personal returns, the GAO found a group of contractors who got all of their business income from single sources. 

   So the IRS is examining 400 randomly selected employers to see whether this relationship indicates that they have misclassified employees as contractors. 
It also is checking employers' records to see if any employees are claiming too many exemptions on Form W-4. 
The study must be ended by Dec. 31, so that the results can be reported to a congressional oversight committee early next year. 

   TENDER IS THE PLIGHT, if you try to define "state coin" for IRA investors. 

   Legal tender, that is. 
The 1986 tax act made certain U.S. gold and silver coins the only collectibles that individual retirement accounts may own. 
The 1988 act adds "any coin issued under the laws of any State" to the favored list. 
That rule's sponsor, Sen. Daschle (D., S.D.), meant to include South Dakota's Bisons and like state issues. 
But is a Bison a coin? 
No, note numismatists. 
A coin has monetary value and is legal tender; only the U.S. government can mint coins. 

   The new law doesn't define state coins or distinguish them from non-monetary medals; and no one, Daschle's aides included, can provide a definition. 
When the IRS gets around to interpreting the new law, it is likely to take a narrow view, some folks say. 
Luis Vigdor of MTB Banking Corp., New York, a major coin dealer, doesn't consider the Bison to be a coin and doesn't understand what the act means by a state coin. 
"There is a glitch in the law that has to be clarified," Vigdor asserts. 

   "Otherwise," the dealer adds, "you are opening a Pandora's box." 

   PAID SOLICITORS got unexplained advances of $13,494, or 33%, of the $40,597 they raised for Senior Citizens of Missouri. 
The St. Louis group spent only $3,620 -- 9% of the gifts -- on events for the elderly. 
So the Tax Court upheld the IRS's denial of exemption to the nonprofit group. 

   ANY EXEMPT GROUP that uses exempt bonds to fund housing for the elderly is limited to $150 million in outstanding bonds. 
Yet the IRS can't identify the bond volume of many organizations, says the General Accounting Office, so it recommends that the IRS revise its reporting requirements. 

   JURORS WHO GIVE UP their jury pay to their employers in return for normal salary now can deduct the surrendered amounts in full, whether or not they itemize deductions. 
The 1988 tax act adds this provision, retroactively to Jan. 1, 1987. 

   SHELTER INVESTORS may find a refund hidden in the 1988 tax act. 

   The 1986 act created confusing and conflicting relationships between "passive" shelter items and other kinds of loss, income, and expenses -- including income and interest costs related to non-shelter investments. 
Generally, says Thomas Ochsenschlager of Grant Thornton, CPAs, you had to reduce non-shelter net investment income by 100% of the passive loss deductible in 1987 under transitional rules before figuring how much investment-interest cost was deductible from investment income. 

   The effect: a lower ceiling on current interest deductions, which are limited by net investment income. 
But a correction in the 1988 act clarifies that the rule is to be phased in, Ochsenschlager says: Investment income is reduced by only 35% of deductible passive loss in 1987, then 60% in 1988, 80% in 1989, 90% in 1990, and 100% in 1991. 
That's a break for investors whose 1987 returns showed both passive-loss deductions and excess investment-interest costs. 

   Many can amend their 1987 returns, deduct more interest, and claim refunds, the CPA says. 

   BRIEFS: Richard Belas, chief counsel to Senate Minority Leader Dole (R., Kan.), resigned as of Dec. 7 to practice tax law with the Washington firm Dow, Lohnes &amp; Albertson. . . . 
Taxpayers are invited to videotape "Tax Tips on Tape," 19 short IRS programs on doing 1988 returns, as they are telecast by public-TV and cable stations.

   An investigation into a close call last month involving President Reagan's jet has uncovered "multiple" air-traffic-control problems in the Northeast corridor's crowded skies. 

   The National Transportation Safety Board released a scathing report of the Oct. 12 incident, which occurred near Newark, N.J. 
It also issued an urgent recommendation to the Federal Aviation Administration to scrutinize immediately practices at a number of air-traffic control facilities in the New York, Philadelphia and Washington areas. 

   The incident occurred in mid-afternoon as Mr. Reagan was being flown from Philadelphia to Newark. 
An error by a controller in the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center allowed the president's Boeing 707 to come within 500 feet vertically and 1.58 miles horizontally of a Bar Harbor Airlines flight. 
Under FAA rules, the planes should have been kept at least 1,000 feet apart vertically and at least three miles apart horizontally. 
The controller was removed from duty, given three weeks of training and allowed back on the job. 

   The safety board uncovered "numerous managerial, operational and training deficiencies in four different air traffic control facilities that contributed, directly, or indirectly, to this incident," the report said. 
The board warned that unless the FAA takes steps to correct the problems, "a serious lack of effective management and quality assurance . . . could lead to an erosion of safety" in the Northeast corridor. 

   An FAA spokesman said the agency would consider the safety board's recommendation.

   Cox Enterprises Inc. named Arnold Rosenfeld editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, succeeding William Kovach. 

   In doing so, the communications company turned to a veteran Cox insider to succeed the high-profile outsider whose resignation has prompted criticism and protests. 

   Mr. Rosenfeld, 55 years old, has been editor of the Austin (Tex.) 
American-Statesman, another Cox newspaper, since 1984. 
He'd spent the previous 15 years in top editing positions at Cox's newspapers in Dayton, Ohio. 
Mr. Rosenfeld was slated to become editor-in-chief of Cox's 19-newspaper chain in mid-1989 and is still expected to assume that position eventually. 
The announcement of his Journal-Constitution appointment said he will help publisher Jay Smith search for a permanent successor to Mr. Kovach. 

   Mr. Kovach, 56, former Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, resigned Nov. 4 after two years as editor. 
Though he had been generally hailed for improving the newspaper, he had clashed with Mr. Smith and other executives over matters ranging from the newspaper's design to control of the chain's Washington bureau. 

   The clash over the latter led to Mr. Kovach's resignation, according to a column by Mr. Smith published in last Saturday's editions. 
The column was written in an apparent response to critical newspaper reports and employee protests about Mr. Kovach's departure.

   California State University officials here said that a computer virus has infected more than two dozen of the school's 1,000 Macintosh computers. 

   The virus slows the computers' printing function but hasn't destroyed any data, the officials said. 
They believe the virus is spreading through infected disks that originally came from a nearby store that rents computers, or from the University of California at Los Angeles, about 20 miles away. 

   Earlier this month, another virus jammed the memories of university and government research computers across the country. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun an investigation to determine whether criminal charges should be brought against the Cornell University graduate student who apparently created that virus.

<HL> Options Abound for the Business Flier </HL>

   The airlines' plan to wipe out some discount fares for business travelers would seem like a big blow to corporate America. 
It isn't. 

   The change, scheduled to start Wednesday, will force some people to pay much higher fares. 
But business fliers will still have plenty of chances to get discount rates. 

   Between New York and Los Angeles, for example, more than 150 discount fares are expected to be available after Wednesday. 
And most of those fares won't have restrictions preventing business travelers from booking them. 

   In fact, in a few cities, some last-minute fliers will be able to get fares that are even cheaper than fares that leisure travelers buy well in advance. 

   "It's going to be tougher for business travelers, but they'll still have plenty of options," says Gerald Aransky, a senior vice president at Heritage Travel, a large travel agency in Cambridge, Mass. 
"The industry is still competitive in too many markets." 

   Last week, the airlines panicked the business community by announcing plans to eliminate discounts on tickets purchased three to seven days in advance and on certain unrestricted one-way fares. 
At first, some companies and airline analysts thought that business travelers -- who usually fly on short notice -- would be forced to pay full coach fares on the vast majority of flights. 

   That would have been unprecedented. 
Currently, business travelers only pay full price on 20% or less of their flights, according to the Air Transport Association. 
Companies forced to pay full fare most of the time would have been forced to sharply curtail travel. 

   "There's no way you could suddenly have all companies pay mostly full fares," says Judith Dettinger-Gardner, a vice president for American Express Travel Related Services. 

   What's really happening isn't quite so drastic. 
Most airline officials and analysts now concede that the change affects only 5% to 10% of all travelers. 
And there are many discounts still available for business travelers on routes where several carriers compete. 

   For example, the full one-way fare from Miami to Newark, N.J., is $397. 
But several airlines are still planning to offer an unrestricted fare of $261 after next Wednesday. 
Most airlines also plan to have an unrestricted, one-way fare of $495 between Los Angeles and New York; full fare is $588. 

   And even lower unrestricted discounts are expected to continue on many routes flown by smaller carriers such as Midway Airlines and America West Airlines. 
America West plans to have an unrestricted one-way fare of $29 between Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

   What's more, airlines plan to continue many other low fares that have some advance-purchase requirements and cancellation penalties -- but don't require weekend stays. 
Those fares are increasingly attractive to companies that can plan ahead. 

   "It's hard for a company to ask someone to stay over a Saturday night," says Stephen Taylor, chief financial officer for Lifeco Services Inc., a large travel agency in Houston. 
"But companies are starting to ask employees to plan their trips better." 

   One example is in the Denver-to-Dallas market. 
Full fare on that route is $320. 
But some airlines plan to have a $215 one-way fare that carries a 25% cancellation penalty and a seven-day advance-purchase requirement -- but no Saturday stay. 

   On the same route, some airlines plan to even offer a non-refundable, $178 round-trip fare next week that can be bought just two days in advance. 
That's $20 cheaper than the non-refundable MaxSaver fares -- which travelers must buy 14 days in advance. 

   Admittedly, many of the discounts -- including the unrestricted ones -- are capacity controlled; that is, airlines apply them to a certain number of seats. 
And the extraordinary bargains, such as the $178 fare, are also sometimes limited to brief holiday periods. 

   "The airlines only open up these (capacity-controlled) fares when they know there's no other way to fill the plane," says Mr. Aransky of Heritage Travel. 
"But if you're lucky, you can get a last-minute bargain."

   Short-term interest rates surged on Oslo markets, easing pressure on Norway's beleaguered krone, which has been hit by a wave of foreign currency speculation. 

   In interbank markets, the cost of overnight funds jumped almost five percentage points to 20% yesterday, Oslo bankers said. 
One-month Eurokroner credits rose an equal amount to 18.08% before easing slightly late in the day. 

   Despite the market rates explosion, Norway's central bank left unchanged at 12.4% the official interest rate it charges on overnight lending to banks. 

   Meanwhile, the krone firmed, closing unchanged at 114.3 against a trade-weighted index of 14 international currencies. 
That still is near the weakest end of the index zone maintained by the central bank and a slide from the krone's 113.47 value Friday. 

   But currency traders said the central bank wasn't as active in foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying less than 1 billion kroner to support the Norwegian currency. 
During the preceeding two sessions, central bank interventions totaled an estimated 12 billion kroner, bankers said. 

   Barring a new burst of speculation, "There are signs that this may be culminating," said Tormod Andreassen, executive vice president of Christiania Bank &amp; Kredit kassen, Norway's biggest bank. 
The interest-rate increase squeezes foreign investors who speculate with short positions, hoping to make a profit by buying currency at a lower price later to repay credits.

   GTE Corp. has chosen Dallas as the headquarters location for its telephone operations, according to Texas real estate sources. 

   A company spokesman wouldn't confirm the choice, but said GTE will make an announcement "in the very, very near future." 
The company has scheduled a news conference in Dallas for 10 a.m. CST today. 

   The new headquarters site is part of GTE's drive to streamline its telephone operations, bringing them up to date to face competition it believes will emerge during the next several years. 
The drive to invigorate GTE's $12 billion local phone operations has been aggressively pursued by GTE Chairman James L. "Rocky" Johnson since he assumed his post last spring. 

   GTE said it plans to move 300 employees from its corporate headquarters here to the phone operations headquarters, which eventually is expected to have several thousand employees. 

   Dallas real estate brokers say that GTE has agreed to lease between 800,000 and one million square feet of office space, mainly in the Las Colinas development near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. 
The company has been negotiating for short-term leases, but eventually intends to build a new headquarters for its telephone operations, possibly within three years.

<DATELINE> KARACHI, Pakistan  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three weeks ago, army troops began building hundreds of cinder block bunkers on the streetcorners of this fractious city, Pakistan's most populous. 
Soldiers set up automatic rifles, aimed out into the traffic, and have been poised ever since with their fingers on the triggers. 

   Karachi residents wonder: Is the army there, as it says, to quell potential violence surrounding Wednesday's national elections? 
Or has the army positioned itself to take over the country once again? 

   The army may be Pakistan's most pervasive institution but it is also one of the most obscure. 
It prides itself as a disciplined and apolitical force in the mold of its British creators, yet, paradoxically, it has ruled Pakistan for most of the nation's 41 years. 
Pakistan's most recent president, Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq, was also army chief-of-staff; he had governed Pakistan for 11 years when he died in a still-unexplained plane crash in August. 

   In the final years of his presidency, Gen. Zia experimented with ways of handing back partial power to civilians. 
But none worked to his liking. 
In May, he disbanded the civilian parliament he had assembled three years earlier, accusing the politicians of bringing Pakistan to the brink of bankruptcy. 

   He had scheduled the new elections before he died. 
Now that a civilian government looms large, the new army chief-of-staff, Gen. Aslam Beg, has been making clear statements of support. 
But the Pakistan army plays such a primary role in national life that a full transfer of power is hard to imagine. 

   "The military penetration of civil society has become sufficiently pervasive that it is likely to be given up only under duress," wrote Rodney W. Jones, an authority on small military powers, in an article on the Pakistani army published before Wednesday's election was called. 

   Army bootprints are all over Pakistan. 
Army engineers sandbag riverbanks against floods. 
Army pilots spray the nation's cotton crops. 
The army built the difficult Karakoram highway, with Chinese help, over a 15,000-foot pass to China. 

   During a wheat shortage in 1978, the army overhauled Karachi port and set up a trucking company. 
In 1979, it expanded into cotton and rice transport. 
Today, the trucking company has 1,600 vehicles and blankets the country so thoroughly that railway officials complain. 

   Army officers run prep schools where young Pakistanis go sculling on the Indus River and dress for dinner in blazers and ties. 
There are army medical and dental schools, a college of electrical and mechanical engineering, and an army language institute. 
The poshest neighborhoods in Pakistan's cities are often the "defense colonies," where lots are developed by military housing authorities, sold cheaply to officers -- and then resold to civilians at a lucrative markup. 

   Army companies retread tires, make fertilizer, cornflakes and porridge, mill sugar, run dairy farms, and market livestock stud across Asia and the Middle East. 
The army is digging a 270-mile drainage trench in southern Pakistan to relieve soil salinization. 
The army sells greenhouses to farmers, helping them grow off-season crops so they don't flock in desperation to the choked cities. 

   Directly and indirectly, the army plays an incalculable role in keeping Pakistan's distorted economy perking. 
Mr. Jones, the author, notes that 500,000 Pakistani households -- 4% of the economically active ones -- have sent young men into the army. 
Add in the households involved in services for the military and nearly 10% of the nation's households are involved. 

   "The army, over the past 11 years, has established in the minds of the people that it alone can do anything," says Arif Hasan, a Karachi architect and social critic. 
"That is why people are demoralized, and that is why this is a lifeless, depressing election. 
We are holding elections only because the army wants us to." 

   Army men aren't supposed to air their opinions of the polls. 
Still, an occasional viewpoint leaks through. 

   "I hope you aren't for 'the little girl,'" sniffs a major, who has been chatting with a visitor when a campaign parade passes. 
"The little girl" is Benazir Bhutto, the young leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, or PPP, an election favorite. 

   The major's condescension is widespread among military men. 
After all, Gen. Zia unseated Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as prime minister when he staged his 1977 coup. 
Mr. Bhutto had held elections that year amid strong allegations of rigging. 
To the army, Mr. Bhutto's performance just added to the evidence that civilian politicians can't do anything right. 

   Class differences reinforce the attitude. 
Pakistani politicians tend to come from rich, landed families that have held semifeudal power for generations. 
They go into politics now because the feudal system is breaking down, and the ballot box is a way to hold on to power. 

   The military, on the other hand, recruits its officers from the lower-middle class. 
The typical young officer today comes from a small town, and has parents who scraped their way up through hard work and sacrifice. 
The army gave him his break, and he is apt to be loyal. 
Such men have little patience for the landed notables. 

   But contempt works two ways, and as problems mounted in 11 years of military rule, the army's image has tarnished. 

   "Who are they to look down on civilians?" asks Dorab Patel, a judge who resigned during martial law when asked to take a loyalty oath. 
"It's the pot calling the kettle black. 
We have all failed." 

   Part of the failings stem from Pakistan's ethnic tension. 
The British decided in colonial times to recruit their Indian army largely in the province of Punjab, in the belief that Punjabis were born to fight. 
Today, Pakistani soldiers still come overwhelmingly from Punjab. 
Punjab has also become Pakistan's most prosperous province. 
Residents of the other three provinces, Sind, Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier Province, resent it. 
They view the Punjabi army as an occupying force. 

   Military spending is also a sore point. 
Mr. Jones notes that while military spending grew 168% between 1974 and 1981, personnel grew only 22%. 
"During those years, Pakistan procured relatively small amounts of arms," he writes. 
"Some of the increased investment, therefore, almost certainly went into satisfying the material wants of personnel." 
No one knows for sure, though. 
Not even the auditor-general can look at the military's books. 

   The public has also chafed at the rising cost, in Pakistani lives, of the military's commitment to help the Afghan resistance, known as the "mujahedeen," topple the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. 
Terrorist bombs and shootings have afflicted Pakistan since its army began supplying and giving sanctuary to the mujahedeen. 

   Resentment peaked last spring when an ammunition dump, kept for the Afghans in the heart of an Islamabad suburb, blew up, killing hundreds of civilians. 

   The army recognizes these problems and their effect on public perception of military rule. 
Officers say they know they can't hope to rule alienated non-Punjabi civilians forever. 
Whether they can make good on their word won't be clear, though, until after Wednesday's election.

   A panel of government advisers is calling for changes in Japan's distribution system and the deregulation of several other industries in a report they plan to submit to the prime minister. 

   The report is in the same vein as the so-called Maekawa report of April 1986, in that it advocates reforms of Japanese laws and practices that have tended to block access to foreign goods and services. 
But sources close to the current committee acknowledge that the new report won't be as popular with foreign countries because it is much more limited in scope. 
Though it won't be publicly released until early December, when it is given to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, it already is being criticized in Japan as lacking depth. 

   The 1986 Maekawa report, named for former Bank of Japan President Haruo Maekawa, is viewed by foreigners as a major turning point in Japanese government policy. 
Japan has moved toward implementing some of its recommendations, such as spurring domestic demand, increasing investment overseas and improving market access for foreign goods. 

   In contrast, critics note that the new report recommends relaxing rules regarding the government-controlled sale of rice in Japan but doesn't advocate lifting the country's ban on rice imports. 
Likewise, it doesn't suggest scrapping the national law restricting the opening of large retail stores, a trade barrier Washington is pushing Tokyo to remove. 
The report instead asks that the government enforce the law more loosely so that more stores can open. 

   Unlike the Maekawa report, which was aimed at heading off criticism that Japan took unfair advantage of the world economic system, the prime purpose behind the proposals of the current report isn't to mollify other countries. 

   "We put the emphasis on how to make the people happier," said a Japanese official who worked with the committee. 
Many of the recommendations seek to lower prices or give Japanese access to goods and financial products -- such as short-term money-market certificates -- they currently can't obtain easily. 
"So foreigners who read our report may be very disappointed," the official said. 

   In addition, a source close to the committee's members said: "We cannot go too far for political reasons." 
Attacking Japan's farm or retail system would mean confronting the core constituencies of Japan's ruling party. 

   The report calls for deregulation in seven areas: retail distribution, trucking, telecommunications, finance, energy, agriculture and new businesses. 
Among specific proposals are cutting electricity prices, reducing international air fares, allowing more private stores to sell rice and to set a market price for the rice, and cutting the red tape involved in obtaining liquor and tobacco sales licenses. 

   The recommendations for long-needed changes were greeted warmly, but the report still was criticized as cautious. 
The Yomiuri Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper, asked in an editorial, "Couldn't it have put the knife into reality more sharply?"

<HL> Letters to the Editor: When Midsize Law Firms Are Suitable </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> FIN </IN>
<TEXT>
   Re your Oct. 19 article "Midsize Law Firms Struggle to Survive": I was one of the partners of Demov, Morris &amp; Hammerling -- one of the firms whose dissolution you described. 
I do take issue, however, with the principal implication of your article -- that there is no longer a place for the midsize, high-quality, general-practice law firm in New York City. 
I, for one, believe that there always will be a place for such firms, notwithstanding my prior experience, and I have put my own money where my mouth is -- by joining Morrison Cohen &amp; Singer, a midsize Manhattan firm. 

   Morrison Cohen &amp; Singer started four years ago as a 20-person firm. 
Today we have approximately 35 professionals. 
Our client base is substantial, and many of our clients share their legal work with us and with large firms -- matching their needs with the firm that can deal most effectively and efficiently with their problem. 
What's made our firm work and thrive, both in terms of economics and job satisfaction, is a special "glue" composed of many constituent parts -- a mutual respect of each other's strengths and abilities, a willingness to take risks, a commitment to share one's values, knowledge and experience not only with associates but also with one's partners and, most important, a belief in the continuing importance of personal honor and integrity. 

   Your article fails to point out that the principal allure of the "megafirm" to individual lawyer-rainmakers is not increased staffing capabilities but rather personal financial betterment, and so to lawyers who view the practice of law as merely another "business" the prospect of financial betterment is reason enough to defect from the midsize firms. 
However, it is certainly possible for the economics of a midsize firm to be as good as those of the megafirms. 
Further, there remain many who believe that the practice of law is not a business, but rather a profession that must be conducted in a businesslike manner. 
This distinction is critical. 

   The central tenet of any business is profit maximization, chiefly achieved through production efficiency. 
Viewed in this light, a law firm would be a kind of paper factory. 
A client's problem is fed into one end, is subjected to processing (by adding units of legal research, writing, word processing, overhead, etc.) and emerges as a finished product (i.e., an opinion, a set of documents, a court decision, etc.). 
Maximizing production efficiency requires that lawyers in such firms become highly specialized. 
Their roles are reduced to those of assembly-line workers: Each specialist attacks only the small piece of the overall problem that lies within his own increasingly specialized area of expertise. 
In a real sense, this kind of megafirm would largely be a conglomeration of superspecialized discrete law practices, no one of which can long survive independently, held together by a "brand name" and a common accounting system. 

   But the model of the megafirm as a business contains the seeds of its own destruction -- overspecialization of lawyers. 
How can the lawyer trained only in the megafirm obtain the one personal quality that distinguishes good lawyers from bad lawyers -- judgment? 
Judgment is obtained only through broad experience, either one's own or the shared experience of others, and it is only through judgment that a lawyer can exercise his most important role as "counselor" to his clients. 
The Fortune 500 clients who engage the megafirms have their own legal "counselors" of course -- their own in-house counsel. 
For such clients, the relative lack of "counselors" at the megafirms (except for those who were originally trained in the smaller firms) poses no problem; the megafirm has in a sense become the back office of these clients. 

   For the clients that do not have their own in-house counsel, the attorney's role as counselor and adviser is critical. 
It is for these clients (although smaller in size, certainly larger in number) that the midsize firm has the most to offer -- lawyers who, while expert in a particular area, also have broad personal experience in other areas and who have had the benefit of sharing the experiences of their partners (whom they know personally and not just as names on the letterhead). 

   It is possible to start from scratch a small-to-midsize law firm in New York these days. 
These should be the firms that successful lawyers would want to run to, not from.

   ---
   I disagree with the views expressed in your article describing the inevitable disappearance of the midsize law firm. 
I am an active, longtime client of one such midsize, midtown law firm, whose spectrum of services and capabilities is perfectly matched to my needs. 
My legal needs, I hasten to add, are various. 

   In the past year alone, my attorneys have assisted me with refinancing my major real-estate holdings in Manhattan, acquiring a residence in Southhampton, estate planning, general commercial transactions concerning my restaurant operations, organizing my soon-to-be-opened new liquor store and tax planning for all of the above. 

   To my law firm, I am an important client and I receive the personal attention that I could not possibly receive at the larger New York firms. 
From the perspective of a successful, growing, medium-size business owner, the midsize firm provides the best delivery of quality legal services -- you get to know personally the specific lawyers with whom you work, you obtain the benefits of various legal specialists' input and advice without feeling as though you're shuffled around from one anonymous department to another, and while the quality of legal work is entirely comparable with that of the larger firms, the cost to the client is not.
